[b][u]I am temporarily unable to update this mod due to a bug in Steam Workshop. In the meantime, if you want the latest version, you can download it in [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/ck2_mods/blob/master/expanded_decisions_prisoners/packaged_mod/expanded_decisions_prisoners.zip]zip format[/url].[/u][/b]

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod adds targeted decisions which allow bulk management of prisoners. This is especially useful when you acquire large numbers of prisoners from sieges.

Specifically:
[list][*]AI and players can choose an automatic destination for all newly-acquired prisoners (house arrest, dungeon or oubliette), via self-targeted decision
[list][*][i](Yes, this means that you might find yourself in the oubliette if you're imprisoned by the AI!)[/i][/list]
[*]Players can move [u]all[/u] of their prisoners to one location (house arrest, dungeon or oubliette), via self-targeted decision
[*]Targeted decisions on other landed characters allow players to perform various actions on all prisoners who belong in that character's court:
[list][*]Move all prisoners from that character to a different location (house arrest, dungeon or oubliette)
[*]Execute or release a single prisoner from that liege; or all prisoners from that liege; or all prisoners from that liege who are in a certain location
[*]Ransom all possible prisoners from that liege; or all possible prisoners from that liege who are in a certain location
[list][*][i](Prisoners will be ransomed in the order of their liege's preference - eg. children before random courtiers - until their liege runs out of money.)[/i][/list][/list][/list]

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list][*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: Minor (default imprisonment location)
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Negligible
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Mostly complete, but with some known cosmetic issues
[list][*][i]Known issue: Sometimes, prisoners that will be affected by a targeted-liege action are listed twice or three times. But they are only ransomed/executed/released once![/i][/list][/list]
