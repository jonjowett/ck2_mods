# Cosmetic trait
expd_pdxrptg_dragonborn_descendant_cosmetic;Dragonblood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
expd_pdxrptg_dragonborn_descendant_cosmetic_desc;[Root.GetFirstName] is descended from a Dragonborn although their descent is so dillute as to be almost irrelevant. Still, some small measure of their ancestor's power flows through their veins and could perhaps be awoken with the right encouragement.\n\nThis cosmetic trait has been added by the §YED: PRT§! submod (because this character's actual Dragonblood trait is hidden even though it should be visible).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
