[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This mod fixes and improves numerous issues with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3346002144]PDXRPTG[/url] mod (which is itself based on Elder Kings).

[h2]Major changes[/h2]
[i](Important impact on most playable characters)[/i]
[list]
[*] Several bugfixes to the Warlord CB, so it can actually be used as originally intended(*).
[*] Completely reworked the magicka system to improve performance and user experience while maintaining the base mod's balance.
[*] Lighting the Dragonfires grants the "Dragonborn Descendant" trait. (**)
[*] Ring of Happiness can [u]remove[/u] stressed/depressed (instead of merely preventing it most of the time). And using it can lead to dependency & withdrawal.
[*] Artifacts are never lost on inheritance.
[*] The default limit on number of specialisms (2) can be increased by 1 by each of:
[list]
[*] Having ever been Grandmaster of a society;
[*] Having a legendary education; and
[*] Being the Dragonborn.
[/list]
[*] Reworked joining criteria for regional societies (eg. Swordsingers)
[*] Reworked Library visits (in the Marketplace): costs are capped; better tooltips; better performance; slightly less chance of long-term study failure for high-stat characters.
[*] Updated the "Steal Artifact" decision, broadening the situations where thieving organisations can be used. And, if an option is blocked, the player is now given an explanation.
[/list]

[h2]Minor changes:[/h2]
[i](Minor impact, or only impacts a small number of playable characters)[/i]
[list]
[*] Secret conversion now works as originally intended(*).
[*] New player-only "Ask to Leave Court" decision which allows many more people to be sent away. (So you can have a court of fewer than 100 people if you want.)
[*] Secret Daedric worshippers can acquire and equip that Daedra's artifact.
[*] Dragonborn descendants can acquire Daedric artifacts (if they have access to a Daedra without worshipping them).
[*] Ability to renounce & resume Necromancy (with heavy penalties in each case)
[*] Request Religious Conversion cannot be spammed
[*] The artifact list for the offmap "Offer Artifact" decision is now grouped (eg: if you have 5 silver rings, they will appear in the list together, instead of being scattered)
[*] Slight rework of society quest eligibility: You can block "Change Focus" quests; and Grandmasters will never receive "Change Focus" or "Minor" quests.
[*] Duelling can now be unlocked by The Pit in the Palace of the Kings (as per its description)
[*] Unknown Vampires/Lycans can now disable event spam asking them to reveal themselves. And they can also deliberately trigger the revelation event.
[/list]

[i](*) Based on the structure of the existing code, code comments, in-game tooltips, and my own interpretation.[/i]
[i](**) Because, according to the lore, only those with dragon blood can light the fires. But the game offers several ways for characters without the dragonblood trait to light the fires. So, it makes sense to recognise somehow that these characters have "discovered" their dragon blood.[/i]

[list]
