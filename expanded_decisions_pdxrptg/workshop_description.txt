[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This mod fixes and improves numerous issues with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3346002144]PDXRPTG[/url] mod (which is itself based on Elder Kings):
[list]
[*] Several bugfixes to the Warlord CB, so it can actually be used as originally intended(*).
[*] Completely reworked the magicka system to improve performance and user experience while maintaining the base mod's balance.
[*] Secret conversion now works as originally intended(*).
[*] New player-only "Ask to Leave Court" decision which allows many more people to be sent away. (So you can have a court of fewer than 100 people if you want.)
[*] Artifacts are never lost on inheritance.
[*] Secret Daedric worshippers can acquire and equip that Daedra's artifact.
[*] Dragonborn descendants can acquire Daedric artifacts (if they have access to a Daedra without worshipping them).
[*] Lighting the Dragonfires grants the "Dragonborn Descendant" trait. (**)
[*] Ring of Happiness can [u]remove[/u] stressed/depressed (instead of merely preventing it most of the time).
[*] Using the Ring of Happiness can lead to dependency - removing the ring when you're dependent on it can [u]cause[/u] depression.
[*] The default limit on number of specialisms (2) can be increased by 1 by each of:
[list]
[*] Having ever been Grandmaster of a society;
[*] Having a legendary education; and
[*] Being the Dragonborn.
[/list]
[*] Reworked joining criteria for regional societies (eg. Swordsingers)
[*] Ability to renounce & resume Necromancy (with heavy penalties in each case)
[/list]

[i](*) Based on the structure of the existing code, code comments, in-game tooltips, and my own interpretation.[/i]
[i](**) Because, according to the lore, only those with dragon blood can light the fires. But the game offers several ways for characters without the dragonblood trait to light the fires. So, it makes sense to recognise somehow that these characters have "discovered" their dragon blood.[/i]

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
As with all of my mods, my aim is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list]
[*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*]Changes to base mod files: Too many to list here!
[*]Mod compatibility:
[list]
[*]Should be compatible with most other mods, unless they specifically alter the exact same features that are listed above.
[*][u]May[/u] be compatible with the base Elder Kings mod, since that is the basis for the PDXRPTG mod. (NB: Not tested!)
[/list]
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: Minimal
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: In progress - I have many more changes/improvements on my to-do list!
