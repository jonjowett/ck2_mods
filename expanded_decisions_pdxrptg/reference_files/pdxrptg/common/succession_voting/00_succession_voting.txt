# The entry should be named in the same way that the elective succession law is named to define it's voter's logic.
# Root scope - Voter, the character voting in the election
# From scope - Candidate, Character considered for the title
# FromFrom scope - The title the nomination is for
# FromFromFrom scope - The title owner's candidate
# The voter will vote for the top score candidate calculated from this script.

### Condensed syntax layout:

#		<MTTH>
#	}
#	elector_selection = {
#		max_amount = <int>
#		<MTTH> - if max_amount is set it will pick the X amount of top scorers.
#				 Negative scores are considered invalid electors - Ruler is always an elector
