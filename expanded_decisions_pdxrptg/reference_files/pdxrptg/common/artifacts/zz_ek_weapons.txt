#Three item quality levels: Normal, Superior, Flawless. Flawless should in general be notably better than Normal with Superior as a middleground between the two.
#Numbers and scale will be tweaked as needed - the normal versions are the artifacts as they currently exist in the SVN as of Revision nr. 1582 except where noted otherwise
#Sorry if I accidentally un-nerfed anything too hard with respect to the above, Nanaki!
#Scripted effect ideas:
#generate_weapon_sword_QUALITY - random list for generating any weapon of a given quality level (normal, superior, flawless)
#generate_any_weapon - random list comprised of previous listed effects

#Eventual plans for multiple weapon types - Sword, Axe, Bow, Staff - Spear?
#Some cultures will be better at one thing than another. Bosmeri bows will be superior to their blades.
#Bretons, for example, in order of proficiency/workmanship: Staves / Swords / Bows / Axes

# Any weapon that does not fit in any already existing category should be placed here

#weapon_sword_ansei #Soon(TM)


#weapon_sword_trueflame #Will probably go unused until somebody makes a Nerevarine event chain. That somebody might be me in the future...
