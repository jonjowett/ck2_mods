EVTDESC_CATFISH_1;Today is Koomu Alezer'i, a holy day in which the heathen layfolk celebrate their Gods and harvest. We can fund the local festivities to maintain local support, restrict the activities for this year, or ban the holiday altogether. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_CATFISH_2;Today is Koomu Alezer'i, the day of acknowledgement. Today all the lay-folk of Sentinel are gathering to thank the Gods for the harvest, whether little or great. Should we celebrate with them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CATFISH_1;Support it to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_CATFISH_2;Yes! The Gods are great and worthy of acknowledgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CATFISH_1;Deny the locals their holiday for now. We can't afford it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_CATFISH_2;I'll sit out this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CATFISH_1;Their ways are blasphemous. Ban the celebrations for the next 10 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_CATFISH_2;I don't care about this damned holiday. Leave me be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
koomu_alezeri_holiday;Koomu Alezeri has been celebrated this year by the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
peasant_unrest_sentinel;I did not let the peasants celebrate Koomu Alezeri this year;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
