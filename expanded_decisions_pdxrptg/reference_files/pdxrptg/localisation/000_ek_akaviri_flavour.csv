ekakaviri.3.fight;Have at them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ekakaviri.4.desc;Setting down my pack for the day, I can't help but be awed by the sight surrounding me. Even in this unforgiving land, there is still beauty to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekakaviri.6.endure;It's going to take more than deadly weather to hold me back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ekakaviri.15.dont;I've got to get back to [Root.Capital.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
