sea_worship_DESC;The islanders of Quey discreetly worship a small collection of Daedric Princes who they deem to be the inexplicable true gods of Nirn. These Quey gods play the deities of other races against each other in order to further their unfathomable goals. Each island of the Quey has numerous names for each Prince, but they are commonly known in Tamriel as Hermaeus Mora, Sheogorath, Vaermina, Nocturnal, and Mephala. The Quey serve the Daedra in order to gain personal power and fully accept that their gods are malevolent. For how insignificant is a mortal's desire when compared to a god's? Of the Princes, Hermaeus Mora is by far the most popular. He is personified by the local Quey Kraken, a creature almost as elusive and powerful as the Inevitable Knower himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
