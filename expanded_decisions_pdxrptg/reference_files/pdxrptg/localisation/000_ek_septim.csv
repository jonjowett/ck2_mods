EVTDESC_SEPTIM_1;Rumors are spreading all over the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] that the Dragonborn has just been discovered. The young man, named Hjalti, allegedly hails from Alcaire and has all the makings of a military genius. He is supposedly offering to join our court as a retainer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_1A;Bring him to me immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_1B;Make this supposed "Dragonborn" disappear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BANISH_TIBER_SEPTIM;Hjalti will flee your court and find another ruler to serve. If there is none left, he might juste decide to seize power somewhere else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_2_1;I have faithfully served under the Empire, but I know that I am capable of far more than this. I am Dragonborn. And I am unstoppable. No man will deny me what should be rightfully mine - and that is the Ruby Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_2_2;It is another peaceful night in [Root.Liege.Capital.GetName], and I retreat in my chamber after a long day of work. As I prepare myself to go to bed, I hear my window open, and before I can turn myself around I hear an assassin rushing towards me, a dagger in his hand. I hear my liege scream in the nearby bedroom, and as I fight the assassin he manages to slit my throat before dying. As blood flows from my throat, I rush to help my liege, and manage to kill them with the help of nearby guards. But it is too late, [Root.Liege.GetFirstName] is already dying...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_3_1;I wake up in the small hours of the morning to hear screaming, and the sound of clashing weapons. I arm myself and rush out my bedroom door to see a bloodbath just outside. Disguised assailants are slaughtering my guards. Suddenly, I feel a sharp pain in the side of my neck, as a hand covers my mouth to muffle my scream. My throat is slit, and I collapse to the ground. As I start to black out, I see [From.GetFirstName] standing over me with a bloody dagger, before skulking out of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_3_2;As all [Root.Capital.GetName] prepares to sleep, I hear my wardrobe and my window open, and assassins rush towards me, dagger in their hand. As I try to fight them off while calling for help, I hear fighting in Hjalti's room, before his door quickly opening. I see him and a couple guards rushing to my room, trying to help me. But before the assassins fall, they plant a dagger in my heart. Hjalti tried to use the ancient power of the Voice to kill the nightblades, but I can see his slit throat preventing him from using it. As I feel myself falling unconscious, I can only pray for the future of my family and the Empire I tried to build...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SEPTIM_3A;I breathe my last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
