idun_askfriend_10d;[From.GetFirstName] thinks we should go down into the market square and play 'Dodge Carts.';;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_11d;[From.GetFirstName] has nothing to suggest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_11o;Fine friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_1d;I cannot decide what to do! I'll ask a friend for advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_1o;What shall I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_2d;[From.GetFirstName] asked me for an idea what [From.GetSheHe] could do. I'll tell [From.GetHerHim]:;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_2o1;Read a book!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

idun_askfriend_6d;[From.GetFirstName] thinks I should do my homework.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_7d;[From.GetFirstName] thinks I should find someone to screw.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_8d;[From.GetFirstName] thinks we should play a game of 'Throw the axe.';;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_9d;[From.GetFirstName] thinks we should play a prank on someone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_allo1;Fine, I'll do that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_askfriend_allo2;No, that's boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_books_1d;I venture into the palatial library. There are so many books! I've read some, but I'll never be able to read all of them. Which one will I pick this time?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

idun_chess_1d;I would like to play chess today! Whom shall I ask to play against?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_1o1;A friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_1o2;Someone of my family.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_1o3;My parent.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_1o4;My guardian.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_2d;[From.GetFirstName] wants to play chess with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_2o1;Sure, let's play.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_2o2;No, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_3d1;You play chess against [FromFrom.GetBestName] and win! You feel great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_3d2;You play chess against [From.GetBestName] and win! You feel great.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_3o;Yay!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_4d1;You play chess against [FromFrom.GetBestName] and lose! You decide to play something else next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_4d2;You play chess against [From.GetBestName] and lose! You decide to play something else next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_4o;Meh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5d;[From.GetBestName] didn't want to play chess against me. I'll find something else to do. I shall...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5o1;Read a book.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5o2;Ride my horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5o3;Explore the castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5o4;Visit the kitchens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5o5;Do some embroidery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_chess_5o6;Ask my friend for an idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_event_tooltip;Character receives an event.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_1d;It's a beautiful day today, sunny but not too warm, and not too much wind either. From my window I can see the water of the nearby lake reflecting the sunlight. The fish ponds which are part of my domain are calling to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_1o1;I shall go fishing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_1o2;I could take my friend along!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_1o3;I'd rather do something else today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_1o4;I'll stay in.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_2d;I go fishing on my own. After I've set up my fishing equipment and cast the line, I sit down to wait if anything bites. It's such a beautiful day, I wonder why there aren't more people out at the ponds.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_2o;I hope I'll catch something!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_4d;My friend [From.GetFirstName] asks me to go fishing with [From.GetHimHer].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_4o1;Sure I'll come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_4o2;I don't want to...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_5d;I continue fishing for a while, until something is pulling on the line! I have to work hard to reel it back in. It's a huge one!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_5o;I love fishing!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_6d;I continue fishing for a while, until something is pulling, but not very strongly. I have no trouble reeling in a baby trout. I'll do better next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_6o;Aw, it's so little.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_7d;I sit at the pond all day, watch dragonflies zoom past and flies dancing above the water's surface, and once in a while I can see a fish in the water. But... they don't bite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_7o;I guess they weren't hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_8d;Suddenly I can hear a snarling behind me, and when I turn around there's a huge grey wolf staring at me! I quickly scale the tree I was sitting beneath, then shout for someone to come save me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_8o;Saved by fishermen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_9d;While sitting next to the water waiting for the fish to bite, a person I've never seen before comes along. He claims to be lonely and says he would like to talk to me for a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_9o1;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_9o2;Sure, why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_10d;The man (or is it a woman?) talks in great detail about all the horrible things that could happen to a child out alone at the lake. I could drown. I could be eaten by wolves, or by the huge mudcrab lurking at the bottom of the water. I could come upon a stranger who abducts me and does horrible things to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_10o;Surely those things don't happen?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_11d;'Hello there little one,' the man says. 'Looks like they aren't biting! Would you like a fish finger instead? But they're mushy inside, and no entrails at all, sadly...' He talks at me for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_11o1;Sure I'll have a fish finger!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_11o2;I don't know what to make of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_12d;We talk about my parents and their opinions for the longest time. They are wrong about so many things!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_12o;And I don't like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_13d;The man asked me if there was anything I wished I had. I thought about it for a while, then told him what I wanted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_13o1;I want a doggie!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_13o2;I want a horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_13o3;I want a kitty!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_13o4;I don't really need anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_14d;My parents or my guardian or someone had told me that I should not go with strangers. I should have taken them seriously, which I now regret. You want to know what happened?\You do not, trust me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_14o;[ROOT.GetRandomGodName] save me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_15d;The man wants to invite me to a party in his palace. 'You've never seen such revelry!' he claims.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_15o1;Sure I'll go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_15o2;No thanks, I have to be home for dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_16d;The man looks scary and horrible, but what he says makes a lot of sense. He tells me how to be strong against my enemies, and how he can help me become even stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_16o1;I'm listening!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_16o2;I'm scared! Leave me alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_17d;I'm taken into a dark, luxuriously furnished hall, all held in tones of red and bronze. The party is rather small, there are only a handful of people besides myself, their attire hinting at origins all over the empire. It seems they have also just arrived. I'm being served wine in a silver goblet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_17o1;Let's sit and drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_17o2;I'll go exploring!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_18d;I have a great time talking to these other young people from all over the realm. There is ale and wine, and we become merry and boisterous. We sing and dance and the time passes too quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_18o1;I abstain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_18o2;I drink too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_19d;You've got to know [From.GetBestName] at a party and enjoyed your time with [From.GetHimHer].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_19o;I've made a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_20d;You've got to know [From.GetBestName] at a party and really did not like [From.GetHimHer].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_20o;I've made a rival!;;;;;;;;;;;;
idun_fish_21d;[From.GetBestName] now considers me a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;
idun_fish_21o;Yay!;;;;;;;;;;;;
idun_fish_22d;[From.GetBestName] now considers me a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;
idun_fish_22o;Meh.;;;;;;;;;;;;
idun_fish_24d;I have a good look around this strange hall and look into every corner and behind every screen. In an alcove a sparsely-clad girl beckons me to join her at cards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_24o1;Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_24o2;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_24o3;I'm intrigued.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_25d;I have a good look around this strange hall and look into every corner and behind every screen. In an alcove a sparsely-clad boy beckons me to join him at cards.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_26d;I sit down in the alcove to play. My new friend explains the rules: We bet one piece of clothing per round. The game does not end there, of course...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_26d;We have a great time! Who cares about possible consequences?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_26o;Let's do it again!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_27d;I never thought I would be having carnal relations with a member of my own sex!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_27o1;I'll not do this again any time soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_27o2;I enjoyed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_27o3;This is what I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_29d;My host catches me at the end of the night and asks me if I enjoyed my time here. He looks as if he wouldn't mind taking me somewhere private.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_29o1;Uh... it was nice I guess?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_29o2;May I say 'thank you' in a special way?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_30d;[From.GetFirstName] agreed to come with and we set out to the pond, where we quickly find a good place to cast our lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_30o;Now we'll just wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_31d;[From.GetFirstName] doesn't want to go fishing with me. [From.GetSheHeCap] said [From.GetSheHe] had something better to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_31o;I'm a bit disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_32d;We sat at the pond all afternoon and caught some fish, but [From.GetFirstName] caught the biggest trout.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_32o1;I don't mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_32o2;Now I'm jealous!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_33d;We make it back home with out catch. No matter what, it was an afternoon well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_33o;Fishing is fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_34d;We sat at the pond all day, but caught no fish. We're both a bit disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_34o;Aw.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_35d;Suddenly we hear a snarling from the bushes, and when we turn around there's a pack of huge grey wolves staring at us! We quickly scale the tree we were sitting beneath, then shout for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_fish_35o;[ROOT.Religion.GetRandomGodName] help us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_decision_friend_1;Look for Friend;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_1d;I feel a bit lonely in the large demesne which is being run for me. I want a friend to play with!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_1o1;Do you want to be my friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_1o2;I shall look for someone who is like me, as we will get along better.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_1o3;There is no one in my realm who could become my new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_2d;[From.GetFullName] wants to be my friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_2o1;I like you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_2o2;You smell funny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_3d;I have found a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_3o;I am happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_4d;[From.GetFirstName] does not want to be my friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_4o;Meh.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_6d;[From.GetFirstName] has changed so much and we keep having arguments about things. I'm not sure I still want to be friends with [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_6o1;I don't want to be [From.GetFirstName]'s friend any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_6o2;I'll be [From.GetFirstName]'s friend regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_7d;[From.GetFirstName] does not want to be friends any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_friend_7o;Have I changed that much?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_1d;I've thought about naked girls, and I found I'd prefer to see my male friend naked... What'll I do?!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_1o1;I'll talk to him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_1o2;I don't know anyone else who feels like me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_1o3;I'll just not act upon it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_2d;My friend [From.GetFirstName] likes me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_2o1;Yay!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_2o2;I don't feel like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_3d;He loves me too!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_3o3;[ROOT.GetRandomGodName]! That's gross-;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_3o;Yay!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_4d;He just sees me as a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_4o;Well...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_5d;I'm attracted to members of my own sex. Perhaps it's time I went out and found someone who feels the same way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_5o1;Go looking.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_gay_5o2;Stay home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_guardian_100d;The teacher just told me my ward and [From.GetHerHis] best friend are skipping school... they've climbed a tree just outside the school room window and are trying to 'hide' up there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_guardian_100o1;I really don't care what [From.GetSheHe] does.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_guardian_100o2;I'll have to talk [From.GetFirstName] out of the tree somehow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

idun_jaded_1o4;He's simply a horrible person!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_jaded_2d;I'm so tired of my guardian [Root.Guardian.GetFirstName] and [Root.Guardian.GetHerHis] ways, of [Root.Guardian.GetHerHis] habits, [Root.Guardian.GetHerHis] opinions, [Root.Guardian.GetHerHis] pastimes! I don't want to be like [Root.Guardian.GetHerHim], it's so old and boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

idun_pastimes_0d;What shall I do today in my free time? I'll have to decide quickly before someone sees I'm not occupied, and heaps more chores on me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_0o1;Explore the castle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_0o2;Visit the kitchens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_0o3;Improve my embroidery.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_0o4;None of the above.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_1d;I sneak off to explore the castle some more. There are always more hidden passages and strange rooms to see. Who knows, maybe I'll find a forgotten treasures somewhere?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_1o;I'm not scared by spiders!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_2d;I visit the kitchen to watch the cooks prepare a meal. The head cook shows me her stores and the accounting, and lets me calculate how much tonight's meal costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_2o;I like numbers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_3d1;I spend the afternoon embroidering a new bodice. I listened to the ladies-in-waiting talk about sundry things. It was very interesting to speak with them about things going on at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_3d2;I spend the afternoon embroidering a new shirt. I listened to the ladies-in-waiting talk about sundry things, but somehow I got the feeling that they were not quite comfortable with me being there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_3o1;I've learnt a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_3o2;They don't like me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_4d;I'm going camping! Perhaps I can even sleep outside in that little tent I have. It's warm and sunny outside!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_4o1;[From.GetFirstName] thinks I'm brave!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_4o2;[From.GetFirstName] thinks I'm crazy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_4o3;Let's find a good place!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_5d;I set up my tent next to a stream in the woods. It was quiet and serene, I even set up a trap to catch something to eat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_5o;So much to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_6d;[From.GetFirstName] still has not come home! I have not seen [From.GetHerHim] all afternoon. I'm starting to get worried...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_6o1;Ah, [From.GetFirstName] will be fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_6o2;Guards, find [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_7d;I spend the night outside in my little camp. There were eery sounds, strange lights and even smells that I had never heard before!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_7o1;It was just owls and water dripping.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_7o2;I don't know what it was!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_8d1;My father had me collected by his guards, claiming I'm too young to spend a night outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_8d2;My mother had me collected by his guards, claiming I'm too young to spend a night outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_8d3;My guardian [FROM.GetBestName] had me collected by his guards, claiming I'm too young to spend a night outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_8o1;That was nice of [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_pastimes_8o2;I'm old enough to decide!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_1d;It's nice weather outside, just right for the season. I could take my horse for a ride around the demesne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_1o1;Let's get going!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_1o2;I've got work to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_2d;I ride my horse through the fields in a slow canter for a warm-up, then do an hour training at ring jousting and the quintain. Later we race through the woods, down the narrow path the adults use when hunting. It goes all the way up to the top of the next hill, and from there the view is magnificent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_2o;I love my homeland!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_3d;I ride down a narrow forest path. Suddenly a flock of birds flies up before me, spooking my horse! It rears, then charges down the path... without me, for I am thrown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_3o;Damn beast!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4d;A band of people suddenly surrounds me! One of them grabs the reins of my horse, another one tries to pull me off its back. I'm being attacked!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4o1;Fight back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4o2;Yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4t1;Abducted!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4t2;Escaped!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4t3;Unhorsed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_4t4;Ransomed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_5d;I've been abducted!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_5o;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_6d;I kick my horse into a gallop, kick one of the men in the throat, hit another across the face with my riding crop even while they are attacking me with their daggers, and make a run for it. My horse is fast, and I leave them behind, bolts whizzing past me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_6o;Escaped!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_7d;I make my horse rear and kick it into motion to ride over the bandits while they are stabbing at me with their daggers. I then race in a full gallop straight home. Once back, the horse is lathered with spittle and I notice a long gash along its flank. It is winded to boot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_7o;I need a new horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_8d;I could offer the band of rogues some gold to buy my freedom before they get the idea of dragging me off to sell me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_8o1;Is this enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_ride_8o2;I'll not bow to kidnappers!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_1d;My friend asked me if we should skip learning today and evade our teacher together. We could climb into the tree outside the teacher's window and watch what's happening inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_1o1;Let's go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_1o2;Let's be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_2d;My guardian didn't care that we skipped our lessons, and the teacher was too craven to climb after us into the tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_2o;Let's do that again tomorrow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_3d;My guardian [From.GetFirstName] gave me a stern lecture why it is important for me to learn as much as possible. I understand I don't know enough to rule well, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_3o1;I'll be good from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_3o2;I don't need to be educated - I'm a noble!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_4d;Not only did my guardian [From.GetFirstName] not approve, [From.GetSheHe] also pulled us out of that tree and birched me and my friend for skipping lessons. I don't think we'll do that again any time soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_school_4o;My guardian hates me!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_1d;A friend tells me he knows where to watch girls bathing naked. He wants me to come along instead of doing my homework!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_1o1;I have more important things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_1o2;Let's go!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_1t;I'll think about it though.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_2d;My friend and I watch the girls from a hidden vantage point for a while, then decide to join in. We swim over to them and they shriek and splash us with water. We start splashing back, and everyone has a lot of fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_2o2;Swimming is fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_3d;It's such a beautiful day today! I should go bathe in the river with my friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_3o1;Come, girls!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_3o2;I'm fine where I am.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_4o1;One of them seems to fancy me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_6d;[From.GetBestName] has come to the river as well. He keeps glancing at me. My friends and I are splashing him with water!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_6o1;He's so sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_6o2;I don't think I like him.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_7d;The girl's name is [From.GetFirstName]. She and her friends are leaving for home now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_7o;Bye!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_8d;I meet [From.GetFirstName], the youth whom I met when bathing with my friends. He still draws my fancy! Should I speak with him?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_8o1;I could never!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_8o2;Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_9d;I meet [From.GetFirstName] in town, the girl I met when we were swimming. I talk to her a bit and she seems like a really nice girl. She wants to meet me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_9o1;That would be great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_9o2;I don't know...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_11d;I go to meet [From.GetFirstName]. We walk around talking until we come to a large tree. Beneath its broad crown we lay on the nice soft moss for a bedstead, with flowers for a pillow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_11o1;I'm in love with [FromFrom.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_11o2;I found a friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_12d;I go on a walk with [From.GetFirstName]. We walk around talking until we come to a large tree. Beneath its broad crown we lay on the nice soft moss for a bedstead, with flowers for a pillow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_12o1;I'm in love with [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_12o2;[From.GetFirstName] is a good friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_13d;We return from our trip to the river, exhausted but exhilarated. We had a lot of fun today, we will have to go swimming again soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_swim_13o;I love swimming!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_3d;Your friend [From.GetFirstName] did not like you disturbing the sermon in church.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_3o;You're such a bore, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_4d;My friend [From.GetFirstName] enjoyed the disturbed sermon in church.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_4o;And so did I!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_2d;My friends and I are sitting in the uppermost gallery of our local church listening to the sermon. One of them starts making funny noises to disturb the priest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_2o1;You really shouldn't be doing that, [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_2o2;Haha! At least some fun in the temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_1d;The temple service is really boring today. I'm trying not to make funny noises to disturb the priest, but it's so hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_1o1;Bllllllllppft!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_temple_1o2;I'll be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_1d;I really want to play with this neat toy my friend [From.GetFirstName] has. Maybe [From.GetSheHe] will lend it to me if I ask nicely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_1o;Pretty please?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_2d;My friend [From.GetFirstName] would like to borrow one of my toys [From.GetSheHe] has been craving for weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_2o1;I'm sorry, [From.GetFirstName], I'm playing with it myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_2o2;I'm sorry, [From.GetFirstName], I've given it to my other friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_2o3;Sure, [From.GetFirstName], I can give it to you for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_3d;[From.GetFirstName] does not want to give it to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_3o;Drat!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_4d;[From.GetFirstName] already gave the toy away!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_4o1;[From.GetFirstName] likes their other friend more!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_4o2;I'll find something else to play with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_5d;[From.GetFirstName] gladly lend me [From.GetHerHis] toy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_5o;Thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_6d;[From.GetFirstName] borrowed a toy quite a while ago... I should ask to get it back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_6o1;Ask for my toy back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_6o2;Let my friend keep it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_7d;[From.GetFirstName] wants [From.GetHerHis] toy back.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_7o1;Here it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_7o2;Toy? What toy?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_8d;My friend [From.GetFirstName] claims not to remember any toy they borrowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_8o1;Maybe I did lend it to someone else?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_8o2;The bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_8o3;I didn't really like it in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_9d;My friend [From.GetFirstName] brought back my toy. I'll play with nothing else for a year!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
idun_toys_9o;I'm so glad!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
