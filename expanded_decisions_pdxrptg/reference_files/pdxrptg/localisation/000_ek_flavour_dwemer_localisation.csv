# Dwemereth
proclaim_dwemereth;Proclaim Dwemereth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
proclaim_dwemereth;Our whole race disappeared during the Battle of Red Mountain, hundreds of years ago. Some of us inexplicably came back recently, and we are now ready to reclaim the land we once lived in. The Dunmer showed they could not be trusted, and this time we will rule Dwemereth alone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PROCLAIM_DWEMERETH_EVENT_CT;You will proclaim to the world that the Dwemer are back and reclaimed Dwemereth. Your descendants will be remembered as part of a glorious bloodline from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
dwemer_flavour.1.t;The Deep Folk rise again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwemer_flavour.1.d;The Dwemer have always been in conflict against with their neighbours. Be they Nords, Chimer, or neighbouring tribes, warfare was common among our race. We thought that the peace between us and the Chimer would last, but the Chimer stabbed us in the back, breaking our alliance and expelling us through improbable magic from this world.\n\nBut we came back. And we took what was once ours.\n\nThe Dunmer are not the masters of Resdayn anymore. We are. And we are here to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwemer_flavour.1.optA;We will never kneel again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwemer_flavour.2.d;Who would thought such a thing was possible? The Dwemer were thought to be extinct for millenia, but they came back, with a thrist for vengeance. They clawed Resdayn from the Dunmer, who were the main inhabitants of the province ever since the Dwemer disappeared and the rise of the Tribunal Temple.\n\nTamriel has changed. The volcanic lands of Morrowind will never be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dwemer_flavour.2.optA;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
