### Decisions
restore_college_cardinals_sun_court;Restore the Solar College;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
restore_college_cardinals_sun_court_desc;Our faith was once guided by the Solarches, representatives chosen by the Great Serpent themselves. As our faith lost ground, the Solarches had to hide from the Sun itself, and could not lead us anymore. It is time to restore the Solar College, and let the Great Serpent lead us once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

### Events
sun_court_flavour.1.t;The Solar College;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sun_court_flavour.1.d;The Solarches were delegates from the Great Serpent themselves. At the height of their power, they used to choose the [d_suncourt.GetRulerTitle] among themselves, who would guide our faith. As the centuries of conflict between the Sun Court and the Five Courts seemed to end with the victory of the Five Courts, the College could not convene and our [d_suncourt.GetRulerTitle] was chosen seemingly at random.\n\nBut as the wars between the Sun Court and the Five Courts finally ended with the Sun Court triumphant, we can now officially sponsor the Solar College, and let them choose who will guide us once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sun_court_flavour.1.optA;A great day for our faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
