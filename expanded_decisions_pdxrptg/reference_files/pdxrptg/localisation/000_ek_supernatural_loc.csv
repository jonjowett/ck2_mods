ek_supernatural.1.t;Child of the Night;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.1.d;It seems that [From.GetFirstName], my newly born child, received a fraction of my vampiric powers. While this will enhance [From.GetHerHis] abilities beyond those of regular mortals, it will not be on the same scale as the powers given by my vampiric blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.1.optA;A curse or a blessing. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.5.t;Child of the Wild;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.5.d;Some of my lycanthropic powers seem to have been given to my newly born child, [From.GetFirstName]. This will make [From.GetHerHim] a much more powerful individual than regular mortals, but [From.GetSheHe] won't receive the full-fledged abilities of a true lycan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.5.optA;A curse or a blessing. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.10.t;A normal child?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.10.d;While I possess supernatural abilities, they do not seem to have been passed on my newly born child, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ek_supernatural.10.optA;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
