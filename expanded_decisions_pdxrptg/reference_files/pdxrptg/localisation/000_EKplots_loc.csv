EKplots.1_desc;[From.GetTitledFirstName] claims [From.GetSheHe] would be more suitable to be your regent than [event_target:target_current_regent.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.1_OPTA;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.1_OPTB;No, I don't think so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.2_desc;I agree, you, [Root.GetFirstName], are more suitable to the position of regent.\n\n[Root.liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.2_OPT;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.3_desc;Your request to be named regent is refused, [Root.GetFirstName].\n\n[Root.liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.3_OPT;I understand, my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.4_desc;[Root.liege.GetTitledFirstName] appointed [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] as [Root.liege.GetHerHis] new regent in your place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.4_OPT;My title...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.5_desc;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pressure me into appointing [FromFrom.GetHerHim] as my regent, but I decided to let you keep the title.\n\n[Root.liege.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.5_OPT;Thank you, my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.12_desc;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to help with his plot to falsify some evidence against [plot_target.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.12_OPT;Let's see what I can come up with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.12_OPTdesc;See if your network of spies can discover a way to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.13_desc;I think I can create a credible enough evident of [plot_target.GetFirstName] misdeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.13_OPTA;Now, where's my pen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lets_try_something_else;On second thought, let's try something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.14_desc;I found a [Root.GetManWomanOpp] who says [Root.GetSheHeOpp] is an expert at forging documents and [Root.GetSheHeOpp] will immediately get to work. But before [Root.GetSheHeOpp] gets to work [Root.GetSheHeOpp] asks for payment up front.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.14_OPTA;I'm sure [FromFrom.GetFirstName] will cover my expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.15_desc;I found a [Root.GetManWomanOpp] who claims to be an excellent actor and could provide a false testimony so convincing that nobody would take into question. All [Root.GetSheHeOpp] asks for is a little monetary compensation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.15_OPTA;I'm sure [FromFrom.GetFirstName] will cover my expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.16_desc;What fortunate find! While I was looking for opportunities to falsify evidence, I found out that [plot_target.GetFirstName] is actually leader of a plot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.16_OPTA;I should immediately notify [FromFrom.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.17_descA;After days of practicing [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s handwriting I believe I created the perfect evidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.17_descB;After days of working in [Root.GetHerHisOpp] private room, the forgerer presented me with a rather convincing letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.17_descC;After days of rehearsing the actor feels fully prepared to give [Root.GetHerHisOpp] false testimony. [Root.GetHerHisOpp] acts is rather convincing, I would say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.17_OPTA;This evidence would convince even [Root.GetRandomGodNameCap]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
not_good_enough;No, this is not good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.18_descA;After days of practicing [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s handwriting I believe I created a decently convincing letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.18_descB;After days of working in [Root.GetHerHisOpp] private room, the forgerer presented me with convincing letter. Not as good as [Root.GetSheHeOpp] claimed it would be, but it will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.18_descC;After days of rehearsing the actor feels prepared to give [Root.GetHerHisOpp] false testimony. [Root.GetHerHisOpp] isn't as good as good as [Root.GetSheHeOpp] claimed, but it will do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.18_OPTA;I hope this will be convincing enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.19_descA;After days of practicing [plot_target.GetFirstName]'s handwriting I believe I created a... well, let's just say it's not my best work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.19_descB;After days of working in [Root.GetHerHisOpp] private room, the forgerer presented me with a really sloppy letter. I could have done it better myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.19_descC;After days of rehearsing the actor says [Root.GetSheHeOpp] is ready. I personally doubt even a rock would believe [Root.GetHerHisOpp] act, but maybe that's just because I know it's fake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.19_OPTA;No one will be the wiser. Except maybe for people with brains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.20_descA;I managed to create a rather convincing evidence of [Root.plot_target.TitledFirstName] misdeeds. I leave it up to you to decide what to do with it! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.20_descB;I managed to create a somewhat convincing evidence of [Root.plot_target.TitledFirstName] misdeeds. I leave it up to you to decide what to do with it! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.20_descC;I managed to create a not very convincing evidence of [Root.plot_target.TitledFirstName] misdeeds. I leave it up to you to decide what to do with it! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.20_descD;Good luck, [Root.GetFirstName]! [Root.plot_target.TitledFirstName] is actually part of a plot, right now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.20_OPTA;Let's send this right away to [Root.Liege.GetTitledName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.20_OPTB;Great! Too bad this plot is not against [Root.Liege.GetTitledName], but [Root.plot_target.FirstName]'s target is surely going to be thankful for revealing this plot! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.21_desc;[From.GetTitledName] has presented you with evidence of [plot_target.GetTitledName]'s misdeeds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.21_OPTA;Oh [Root.GetRandomGodNameCap]! [plot_target.GetTitledName] did what?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.21_OPTB;This evidence is... extremely suspicious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.22_desc;Thank you for bringing this matter to me [Root.GetTitledName]. I make sure that [Root.plot_target.GetTitledName] will get apprehended for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.22_OPT;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.23_desc;Who you take me for [Root.GetTitledName]? A rock can see through your lies. I will keep my eyes on you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.23_OPT;This is not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.24_desc;I have found a [Root.GetManWomanOpp] who can help you with your plot, however [Root.GetSheHeOpp] asked for significant amount of money. I trust you could pay for my expenses. This is, after all, your plot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.24_OPTA;Oh, but of course. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.24_OPTB;I'm thankful for your help [From.GetFirstName], but I never promised to pay for anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.25_desc;It come to my attention that [plot_target.GetTitledName] was plotting against you. I enclosed the evidence in this letter, I urge you to take a look at it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.25_OPT;Thank you [From.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.32_desc;Last night your liege has thrown a grand dinner party that all [Root.liege.GetHerHim] vassals were invited. During the party you come across a group of people who were having a really intense conversation, but as you approached them they all got quiet and the group suddenly dispersed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.32_OPT;I wonder what they were talking about...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.33_desc;It keeps happening. You catch two people talking, but as you approach them they suddenly stop talking and just stare at you, making you rather uncomfortable.\n\n ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.33_OPT;This is worrisome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.34_desc;Things are getting worse and worse everyday. People are not even trying to pretend they feel comfortable around me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.34_OPT;Why is this happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots_i_dont_care;I really don't care what others think of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.35_desc;The looks... THE LOOKS. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.35_OPT;I just want this to end finally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.35_OPTdesc;[Root.GetFirstName] decides to end this once and for all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.36_desc;[Root.GetTitledFirstName]!\n\n Unfortunately I feel that you are no longer suitable for the position of [Root.GetJobTitle]. \n\n [Root.liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.36_OPT;Wha...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.37_desc;My dear lover [Root.GetFirstName]! \n\n Our relationship can't continue anymore. Farewell, my love \n\n [Root.liege.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.37_OPT;No....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.38_desc;My dear consort [Root.GetFirstName]! \n\n Our relationship can't continue anymore. Farewell, my love \n\n [Root.liege.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.38_OPT;No...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.39_desc;Your attempts to start rumours about [Root.plot_target_char.GetTitledFirstName] is going perfectly. People are already visibly avoiding [Root.plot_target_char.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.39_OPT;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.40_desc;Unfortunately your attempts to start rumours met with suspicious looks and now people are whispering about you instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.40_OPT;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.51_desc;[target_plotter.GetTitledName] has been plotting against me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.51_OPTA;[target_plotter.GetSheHe] tried to falsify evidence?? Our liege must now about this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.51_OPTB;[target_plotter.GetSheHe] slandered my name? That bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.52_desc;[target_plotter.GetTitledName] tried falsifying evidence against me! My liege, I ask you to disregard anything [target_plotter.GetSheHe] says!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.52_OPT;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.53_desc;It seems my plot target has learned of my efforts to create false evidence about [Root.plot_target_char.GetHerHis] misdeeds and informed our liege about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.53_OPT;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.54_desc;I know of your attempts to slander my name. We are now sworn enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EKplots.54_OPT;This didn't go according to my plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
