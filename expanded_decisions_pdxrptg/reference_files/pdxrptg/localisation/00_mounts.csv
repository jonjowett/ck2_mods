mount_argonian_shellback;Argonian Shellback;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_argonian_shellback_desc;These large turtle like beasts are the preferred mounts of the Argonian's native "cavalry". While they are slower than any other mount, their shells and tough hides make them nigh-invincible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_camel_hammerfell;Hammerfell Camel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_camel_hammerfell_desc;Single-humped Camels native to the deserts of Hammerfell. These long-legged furred beasts are better adapted to the environs of their homeland and have found wide usage amongst the Redguard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_camel_potun;Ottaka Camel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_camel_potun_desc;The Ottaka Camel is a breed of Camel native to the area of Akavir inhabited by the Po'Tun Cat peoples and is used as their primary mode of transportation in the deserts as well as a highly efficient mount for their cavalry. While slower than a horse the beasts are highly adapted to their desert home and far much better than horses in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_charger;Velothi Charger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_charger_desc;According to Dunmeri myth the Velothi Charger is so named due to its origins in the days of the Prophet Veloth. Bred initially as a pack animal for the dunmer as they migrated into Morrowind and Vvardenfell this particular strain of the reptilian Guar proved itself to be very fast and agile, at least compared to many of the wildlife of Morrowind, and it quickly earned the favour of the Dunmeri Cavalry, for what it was in those days. Today the Velothi Charger is still the preferred mount of the Dunmer Riders, it may not be as fast as the newer breeds nor as agile but it has better staying power, it's thick hide and stubborn nature serving it well on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_flanker;Blackmarsh Flanker;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_flanker_desc;The Guar are a race of reptilian beasts native primarily to Morrowind and Vvardenfell, however there are some specimens who inhabit the northern areas of Blackmarsh. These Guar, under environmental pressures from the myriad predators in Blackmarsh, evolved to be faster and more agile than their northern cousins. From this native stock the Argonians bred a fast and nimble steed, popular amongst the swamp-dwellers for racing as well as war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_kagouti;Kagouti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_kagouti_desc;Kagouti;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_snapper;Vvardenfell Snapper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_guar_snapper_desc;Bred from a particularly belligerent strain of Guar found only on Vvardenfell, the Snapper quickly became popular with Ordinators from the Temple. It was originally bred by tenant farmers working around the temple grounds on Vvardenfell for fighting upon which the farmers would bet their meager earnings. The Ordinators, witnissing the spirit with which the animals fought confiscated a handful of the beasts and bred them into their current form. Their belligerent nature is intact, making the Snappers true to their name and also difficult for newer riders to manage, but those that perservere will have difficulty finding a better war mount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_cerigyn;Cerigyn Nojan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_cerigyn_desc;An incredibly old breed originating from the now virtually extinct Akaviri nations, perhaps one of the oldest extant breeds of horse in the whole of Nirn. Shorter, stockier than your traditional Horse, the Cerigyn is closer to a heavily built pony than a full sized war horse. Never the less the Cerigyn served the Akaviri nations during their time of dominance in Akavir prior to the rise of the snakemen. They are a loyal, hardy breed well suited to the skirmishing battles the Akaviri once fought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_courser;Iliac Courser;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_courser_desc;The Iliac Courser is High Rock's premier warsteed. Agile, fast and almost as heavily built as a Colovian Destrier the Courser is the preferred mount of Breton Lords and is featured heavily in tapestries and stories of the noble Tournaments or the charging of shining knights upon the battlefield. The breed's pedigree can be traced almost back to the days of the Direnni Empire, indeed the breed is a modern descendent of the very steeds the Direnni used to dominate High Rock during that period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_destrier;Colovian Destrier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_destrier_desc;Descended from a blended lineage of Nordic Mountain Horses and the lighter breeds found in the province of Cyrodiil the Colovian Destrier is one of the most highly sought after horse breeds in Tamriel. Heavily built, the Destrier is capable of charging the most heavily armoured rider into battle using it's own body as a battering ram.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

mount_horse_frostmare_desc;DESC STRING;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_hobbeye;West Reach Hobbeye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_hobbeye_desc;A loyal, tough breed that originates in the western reaches of Skyrim, although the horse is actually a descendent of Bretonnian stock bred originally for labour hauling ore trains from the mountainous regions to the coastal and lowlands of High Rock. Since it's genesis however the West Reach Hobbeye has proven itself to be an easily trained, obedient steed with great steel in the face of battle and is a favoured riding animal of nobles across High Rock and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_jennet;Altmeri Jennet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_jennet_desc;Originally bred for horse racing from a similar stock to the Bretonnian Palfreys, the Altmeri Jennets are amongst the fastest horses in Tamriel. Their light frames however make them less well suited to warfare than other horse breeds, this however has not prevented their heavy usage in such roles amongst nobles and cavalrymen who prefer speed and agility over lumbering behemoths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_mijako;Tsaesci Mijako;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_mijako_desc;Similar in build to a Common Rouncey the Mijako is actually descended from a pairing of an older forgotten Tsaesci Horse breed and the Akaviri Cerigyn Nojan, whom the Tsaesci procured in large numbers following the conquests of the Akaviri nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_mountain;Nordic Mountain Horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_mountain_desc;One of the largest and oldest extant horse breeds in Tamriel, the Nordic Mountain Horse is highly adapted to the mountainous and rocky terrain of it's ancient homeland Atmora and it's new adopted homeland of Skyrim. With it's broad shoulders, muscular	build and dense hoofs it is able to scale even the shearest of rockfaces, a feat that has lead to myths of descent from an ancient pairing of a longforgotten mountain goat deity and a mare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_nightmare;Nightmare;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_nightmare_desc;A lesser Daedra that takes the form of a horse with burning eyes and flaming hooves. Many conflicting legends surround its mysterious origins, although it is most often associated with Mehrunes Dagon. It is a brave soul who uses one as a Mount as their chaotic and difficult temperament may lead to serious injury for those unable to tame, or dominate, it's demonic spirit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_palfrey;Bretonnian Palfrey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_palfrey_desc;The Bretonnian Palfrey is considered to be something of a baseline Horse well suited to riding, light labour work and cart pulling and as a warhorse. It's true calling however is the horse race where it has for generations maintained an almost undefeated record amongst the champions of the sport, at least until the advent of the Altmeri Jennet some years ago. The Palfrey still manages to hold it's own however and this popular breed is far from finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_rouncey;Common Rouncey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_rouncey_desc;One of the most common horse breeds in Tamriel, the Rouncey is used in all facets of Tamriel life from farming to riding to warfare. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_shadowmere;Shadowmere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_shadowmere_desc;A mysterious undead horse that is somehow linked with Sithis and the Dark Brotherhood. Shadowmere is not "owned" but rather chooses it's rider from amongst the most worthy of the Brotherhood's members, and maintains a link with them even in their deaths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_pahmar;Pahmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_pahmar_desc;A Pahmar, more specifically a Pahmar-Raht is a quadruped form of the Khajiit resembling a large tiger. Fierce and loyal, the Pahmar is the most common "ridden" Khajiit in Elsweyr. Only other Khajiit are able to ride these cats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_senche;Senche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_senche_desc;A Senche is a large lion like Khajiit used as a warsteed by other Khajiit. The Senche is so highly valued in this role that it is sometimes referred to as a Battlecat or Warcat, similarly to the term "Warhorse". Only other Khajiit are able to ride these Warcats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_senche_raht;Senche-Raht;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_senche_raht_desc;Behemothic lion-like Khajiit, the Senche-Raht is more a mobile battering ram than a Steed. Their size makes them lumbering hulks of muscle, claws and teeth but few mounts are able to match their ferocity and violence in battle. Only other Khajiit, brave ones at that, are able to ride the rare Senche-Raht.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_ghost_horse;Skeletal Ghost Horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_ghost_horse_desc;Summoned from a plane of Oblivion, this skeletal beast courses with arcane energy. It never tires, making it exceptional for long-distance travel, though it has a tendency to fade back into the ether once dismounted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_unicorn;Unicorn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mount_horse_unicorn_desc;A lesser Daedra transported from Hircine's Hunting Grounds, this great beast is exceptionally beautiful and strong, but altogether willful when in the presence of armed individuals. As they are not native to Nirn, Unicorns are a rare sight indeed and highly sought-after.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
