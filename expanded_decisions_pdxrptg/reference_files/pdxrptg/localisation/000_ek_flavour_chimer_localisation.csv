# Resdayn
proclaim_resdayn;Proclaim Resdayn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
proclaim_resdayn_desc;Our brothers and sisters and Resdayn were betrayed millenia ago and rightfully cursed by Azura for their treachery. We were far aways from Azura's wrath, but the time has come to launch an expedition in Resdayn, and reclaim the land that was ours before the Dunmer betrayed their race and their gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PROCLAIM_RESDAYN_EVENT_CT;You will proclaim to the world that the Chimer are back and reclaimed Resdayn. Your descendants will be remembered as part of a glorious bloodline from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
chimer_flavour.1.t;The Changed ones are back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chimer_flavour.1.d;Millenia ago, our race ruled Morrowind. A fragile alliance of Chimeri and Dwemeri tribes ensured that Resdayn was peaceful and prosperous, until our races clashed and we were forced into war. The Battle of Red Mountain saw the disappearance of both our races. The Dwemer vanished out of Tamriel, and the Chimer, our brothers and sisters, betrayed the Good Daedra and were cursed by Azura for their action. Our settlements in Cathnoquey were spared from Azura's fury, and it is time we take Resdayn from those who betrayed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chimer_flavour.1.optA;Their treachery has been avenged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chimer_flavour.2.d;It seems not all Chimer were cursed by Azura. Some settlements in Cathnoquey were spared by Azura, and in the recent years they managed to land in Morrowind and take it back from the Dunmer.\n\nTamriel has changed. The volcanic lands of Morrowind will never be the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chimer_flavour.2.optA;An interesting development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
