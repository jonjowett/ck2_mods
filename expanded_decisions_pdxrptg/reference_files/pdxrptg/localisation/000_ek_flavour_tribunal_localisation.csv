### Events
tribunal_flavour.1.d;After assuming the title of [Root.GetTitle], we are ready to guide the Dunmer and help them follow the path of the Tribunal. As one of our first actions, we must decide if Vvardenfell is to stay out of the reach of the Great Houses, which would let the locals live in peace, or if they should be allowed to colonize the area, which would help the Dunmer prosper...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribunal_flavour.1.optA;Invite the Great Houses into Vvardenfell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribunal_flavour.1.optB;Vvardenfell is to be off-limits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribunal_flavour.2.d;[FromFromFrom.GetDynName], the old [FromFromFrom.GetTitle] of the Temple, died earlier today. One of the first actions [FromFromFrom.GetHerHis] successor [From.GetDynName] took was choosing whether we are allowed to colonize Vvardenfell or not. Some Temple representatives have already arrived to let us know the decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribunal_flavour.2.optA;Vvardenfell is open to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VVARDENFELL_COLONISATION_ALLOWED_CT;If we are in a Great House Society, we will be able to use our §YClout§! and a large amount of money to petition the [From.GetTitle] to let us colonize a small territory in Vvardenfell. If [From.GetSheHe] accepts, we will gain a §Ynew holding§! in the county we targeted. It will help us prosper and could lead to cultural changes in the area due to the displacement of the local tribal Ashlanders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tribunal_flavour.2.optB;We won't be able to colonize Vvardenfell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VVARDENFELL_COLONISATION_FORBIDDEN_CT;Unless we have a huge amount of §YClout§!, a lot of gold to spare, and good relations with the [From.GetTitle], colonization of Vvardenfell will be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
