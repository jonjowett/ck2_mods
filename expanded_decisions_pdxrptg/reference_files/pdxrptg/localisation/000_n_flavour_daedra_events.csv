N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1D;I go for a stroll in the forest when I come upon Hircine, the Huntsman of the Princes. He asks me to join his hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1O1;Of course I will join you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1O2;I'll take my falcon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1O3;Madness! Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1O4;Ahwoooooo!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1T124;The hunt is on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE1T3;Coward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE2D;I ride with the hunt which roams far and wide, searching for prey. When I come upon a large boar, I see a worthy foe and attack it. It turns on me - I ready my spear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE2O;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE23T;Character receives an event;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE3D;I take my falcon hunting. Throwing it into the sky, I can see it cycling higher and higher... until it drops down again, to come away with a rabbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE3O;Good bird!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE4D;'You call yourself a hunter?' asked Hircine. 'Coward! You are a disgrace to all hunters! However, you might be good enough for being hunted yourself.' Being the sporting type, he gives me a head start.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE4O;Run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE5D;I can hear Hircine's hunt behind myself again. They're still on my heels, the damned curs. I have to run away and hide!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE5O1;Run straight ahead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE5O2;Run left;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE5O3;Run right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE5T123;Keep running;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE6D;I survived the boar's attack, but it managed to wound me despite impaling itself on my boar spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE6O;Aaaah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE7D;I survived the boar's attack, but it managed to gore me despite impaling itself on my boar spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE7O;Aaaah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE8D;I survived the boar's attack, but it managed to kill my horse despite impaling itself on my boar spear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE8O;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE9D;I was mortally wounded during the hunt and die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE9O;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE10D;I roamed far and wide with the other hounds. It was a glorious hunt - we caught a lot of prey, animals and mortals both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE10O;Arf! Arf!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE11D;The Huntsman of the Princes is pleased with my actions in the hunt. He grants me a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE11O;Praise Hircine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE12D;I managed to escape Hircine's Hunt, but fell off the tree I had hidden in and injured myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE12O;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE13D;Hircine's Hunt caught up with me. I managed to escape, but not before I got mangled by the hounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE13O;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE14D;Hircine's Hunt caught up with me. I managed to escape, but my horse got mangled. I had to put it out of its misery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE14O;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE15D;Hircine's hunt caught up with me and tore me to pieces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE15O;Damn Hircine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE16D;I managed to escape Hircine's Hunt... this time. Next time, I might not be so lucky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE16O;Whew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE17D;My hunt was pretty successful. My bird caught so many rabbits that I had my servants sell them at the market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE17O;Good bird!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE18D;My hunt wasn't very successful. It's just enough for coney stew tomorrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE18O;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE19D;The Huntsman of the Princes is pleased with my actions in the hunt. He grants me a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_HIRCINE19O;Praise Hircine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT ONE
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE1D;The daedric lord Sanguine told me that he wants to use my castle for a little party to add a bit of spice to an otherwise drab existence. He said this place was too dull right now. I could refuse, but that might anger him. Also, a small party can't hurt, can it? Oh, what if it became too wild?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE1O1;I can't resist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE1O2;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# EVENT THREE (THE SECOND ONE)
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE3D;My great-hall is being transformed into a banquet hall. Decorators brought huge bouquets of flowers, colourful garlands, and a gilded spherical cage with two live peacocks which they hung up in the centre of the hall above the trestle tables. The most outrageous food and most expensive drinks are being delivered from all over the world, it seems. I've just been handed the bill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE3O;Oh joy. He could have warned me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# EVENT FOUR
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE4D;'Excellent! The decoration, the ambiente... simply marvellous. We shall have such fun!' exclaims Sanguine upon seeing your newly renovated banquet hall. 'Now, for the guests. Let's invite your whole realm for a few weeks!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE4O;Let's party! Wait... what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE45D;AI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE45O;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT FIVE
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE5D;Everyone seems to be having a good time. The food is plentiful and tasty, the wine is great, and everyone is having fun. Except for this one person scowling at me, that is... what a bore [From.GetTitledName] must be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE5O;[From.GetFirstName] is embarrassed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE55D;AI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE55O;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT SIX
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE6D;[From.GetTitledName] is looking for a fight and keeps picking on random people. I hope no one rises to [From.GetHerHis] baiting, else there might be blood. The party was so peaceful until now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE6O;Damn, someone did!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE65D;AI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE65O;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT SEVEN (SIX PART TWO)
# this really needs FromFromFrom.GetTitledName, which is broken
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE7D;'You keep looking at me funny. If you don't go away right now, I'll punch you in the face!' you hear [From.GetTitledName] mutter. And then he is punched first, and pulls out his dagger. Somebody stop them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE7O;Ouch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# EVENT EIGHT
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE8D;Someone has just read out a scroll called 'Stark Reality' which was lying around and suddenly everyone is nude. I'm sure that's happened somewhere before - it must be a speciality of Sanguine's. Really, people should stop reading random scrolls out loud. --- Look at all those handsome people (and some not so handsome wrinkly ones. Ugh! Better look at the handsome ones).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE8O;Oh dear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT EIGHT POINT FIVE: I AM SANGUINE
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE85D;AI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE85O;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT RANDOM
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE9D;I observe a very beautiful woman at the party. I hear myself suggesting to go somewhere else for some more private fun. I feel as if I'm under a spell! It is crazy, but I cannot control myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE9O;Let's have some fun, dear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# EVENT RANDOM PART TWO
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE10D;I am approached by a very handsome man at the party. He suggests a private room in a side wing of the castle... I feel as if I'm under a spell! It is crazy, but I cannot resist at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE10O;Oooh yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# EVENT ELEVEN
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE11D;A very drunken Sanguine in the shape of a courtier approaches me at the end of the party and drags me into a quiet corner. 'You're so pretty. But you need to lighten up a bit more,' he hits on me, slurring his speech, 'and have some fun. No need to worry, I'm not Molag Bal.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE11O1;As long as no one sees us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE11O2;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE11T1;Your realm will react;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


# EVEN TWO (THE LAST ONE)
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE2D;'That was quite the rousing party, I must say! Well done, mortal, it was worth my time... for a while. And here's a little something for your efforts. Maybe we'll celebrate again some day...' Sanguine tells me while showing me what he has to offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE2O1;I'll take the gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
N_DAEDRA_SANGUINE2O2;A rose! How pretty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
