EVTDESC_vamp_depth_resent;Being a vampire has its perks, but sometimes you wonder if this state of existence is something you should be grateful for at all. Perhaps vampirism is, as common wisdom would have it, a curse. A curse that makes you prey on innocents who never did you any harm, a curse that makes you a monster in the eyes of gods and mortals alike. A curse that was visited upon you by your sire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_vamp_depth_resent;My sire shall pay for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_vamp_depth_dont_resent;Nonsense, vampirism is a blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_vamp_depth_resent_no_more;I have been wondering lately if the wrath I have felt towards [From.GetFirstName] for turning me into a vampire has been justified. Sometimes I feel the benefits of vampirism outweigh the disadvantages, and if that is the case, should I not be thankful for my vampirism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TOOLTP_vamp_depth_no_longer_resent;You forgive your sire for turning you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_vamp_depth_no_longer_resent;Vampirism is a gift, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_vamp_depth_still_resent;No, I will still want to make [From.GetFirstName] pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
