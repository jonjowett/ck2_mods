adventures1desc;An adventure can take a long time, and can often take you into unpredictable places where even the most basic of supplies are scarce and you may not come across a civilised settlement for many days. Purchasing dried rations and keeping them stowed in your pack will ensure you don't starve to death in some random dungeon, your only companions the restless undead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventures2desc;You never know what situation you might find yourself in, perhaps you're a mage and you like to stand a good distance lobbing fireballs, but what happens if you run out of magicka? Or perhaps you're a knight in heavy plate who likes to swing his sword about, but what should you do if your trusty sword should shatter or break? Purchasing additional sidearms and offhand weapons for your adventure will ensure you're equipped for any situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventures3desc;Any adventurer knows that a good stock of potions, restore health, restore magicka, perhaps an invisibility potion or two could save your life at the last moment, the magickal essences within mending broken bone and torn flesh. While you could perhaps always come across potions while adventuring, it's a risky proposition, and purchasing a few bottles now before you set off could save your life later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
adventures4desc;The time draws near when you must pack up the last of your supplies and head out of the door into the cold night, setting out on your main quest. Before you leave, your spouse draws you close, and you spend one last night together, the chance that you might not return bringing out a passion in your partner you had not before experienced...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

adventures202desc;A hail of arrows, a butchery by sword and axe. Using my martial prowess I have slaughtered my foes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
