learning_necromancy_modifier_desc;[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick] is learning the Dark Arts of Necromancy, in an attempt to gain power over the dead.\nCurrent progress: [Root.GetLearningNecromancyStep];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
study_necromancy;Study Necromancy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
study_necromancy_desc;The Dark Arts have been studied by generations of mages, for good or ill-purposes. But no matter the goal, the prospect of manipulating the souls of the dead is sure to attract many ambitious mages... Perhaps you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
STUDY_NECROMANCY_NO_FLAG_CT;You can only attempt to master the Dark Arts once every five years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.1.d;Studying the Dark Practice is a sure way to learn Necromancy, but it will take its toll in both your body and soul.\nThe reward may by worth the cost, but will you press forward in your studies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.1.optA;The dead will learn to obey me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_BEGINS_CT;You will get an §Yopportunity§! every one or two months, roughly, which can either help your studies, or push it backwards.\nShould you succeed enough, you will become a full-fledged Necromancer.\nShould you fail, you won't be able to try again for a couple years, and your sanity will surely take a hit in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.1.optB;No, Necromancy is too dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.2.d;After months of study, you finally unlocked the secrets of the Dark Arts, and are now ready to command the dead! The world may despise you, respect you, or fear you, but none can deny your powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.2.optA;The dead and the living will bow to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.3.d;Maybe your soul nearly broke due to the Dark Arts, maybe your innate talent isn't enough, or maybe you just can't grasp some fundamental concept. But no matter the reason, it seems Necromancy is too difficult for you to understand and master.\nYour body and mind will need time to rest, should you want to try again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.3.optA;An utter failure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.4.d;You have made some success towards learning Necromancy. Soon you will be able to control the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.4.optA;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.5.d;Your progress towards the understanding of Necromancy had to suffer a small setback. You merely lost your time, and didn't get anything in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.5.optA;I will have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.6.d;The last few days have been very important in your understanding of Necromancy, and you have seen a major success in most of your experiments. Soon you will be able to control the dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.6.optA;Great!
necromancy.7.d;The disastrous last couple of days made you lose a lot of progress towards your learning of the Necromantic Arts. If you keep failing your experiments, you will have no choice but to abandon your studies for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.7.optA;I will have to try harder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_FAILURE_CT;This failure has already taken its toll on your mental and physical health, and as a result you won't be able to try again for another 5 years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# Soul shaken
necromancy.11.d;In your learning of the Dark Arts your soul has been shaken too often to count. The things you saw and did would repulse most other mortals, and some might even warrant for an execution in most parts of the world. But still, you must press forward... Always. No matter the costs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.11.optA;Maybe I should take it slowly for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_SOUL_SHAKEN_SLOWLY_SUCCESS_CT;Success, and you will be able to go forward without corrupting yourself too much;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_SOUL_SHAKEN_SLOWLY_FAILURE_CT;Failure, but your soul won't suffer too much because of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.11.optB;Press forward, my soul be damned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_SOUL_SHAKEN_PRESS_SUCCESS_CT;Great success, and you will learn great and terrifying new things, while corrupting your soul in the process;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_SOUL_SHAKEN_PRESS_FAILURE_CT;Utter failure, and your sanity might take a hit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.12.d.1;You have taken some time for yourself and your sanity, and it seems to have bore its fruits. While you haven't progressed a lot in your learning of Necromancy, you have recovered some of your strength and will be able to press forward from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.12.d.2;Even after some time to recover, you still have trouble sleeping and haven't been able to recover. While your studies won't suffer any setback, you won't see any progress either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.12.d.3;Most people would have stopped for a while, but you decided to press forward, consequences for your soul and sanity be damned. And it seems to have been worth it. Recent breakthroughs and new understandings in the arts of Necromancy mean that soon, the world will have to acknowledge your powers!\nIt has not been without cost however, and your personality might change...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.12.d.4;The last few weeks have been a disaster. Every experiment failed, you have not been able to properly sleep, and when you did nightmares plagued your rest. It seems that you are forced to set your studies aside for a while, but even that might be too late for your sanity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Handling corpses
necromancy.13.d;To resurrect the dead, one must first have the corpses needed. Some bodies need to be thoroughly cleaned, if one wishes to raise a skeleton, while others still have rotten flesh that must be assembled with other rotting parts, like the zombies require. But no matter what the corpses are for, handling them is still a dangerous activity, as they tend to be full of potential diseases.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.13.optA;It might be better if I spent less time around corpses for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_CORPSES_HANDLING_SLOWLY_SUCCESS_CT;Success, and without risking your health or appearance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_CORPSES_HANDLING_SLOWLY_FAILURE_CT;Failure, but at least your environment won't be full of deadly diseases;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.13.optB;To learn, one must be ready to take risks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_CORPSES_HANDLING_PRESS_SUCCESS_CT;Great success, but you will neglect your physical appearance, potentially permanently. Being around dangerous diseases could also strengthen your body, making you healthier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_CORPSES_HANDLING_PRESS_FAILURE_CT;Utter failure, and being around so many corpses will severely impact your health;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.14.d.1;You spent the last couple of days cleaning your workspace, avoiding contact with corpses, and learning more theoretical knowledge. While you still will have to raise corpses if you wish to become a Necromancer, you're one step closer to understanding the Dark Arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.14.d.2;You cannot grasp more theoretical concepts, you need to apply what you learned, and for that one requires corpses to prepare. At least your workspace isn't so filthy anymore. The only thing you lost is time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.14.d.3;Casting most mortal conventions aside, you spent the last couple of days all around corpses, cleaning some to raise skeletons, or patching various rotten flesh parts together, in order to get some zombies. You've learned a great deal of practical knowledge, even if people around you seem to be uncomfortable around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.14.d.4;Being around so many corpses in the last couple of days has taken a heavy toll. You haven't been able to learn anything meaningful, and even worse you start to feel ill. It is yet unclear if this will soon pass or if it is something more serious. But no matter the result, your research has suffered a major setback.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_CORPSES_HANDLING_PRESS_FAILURE_DISEASE_CT;Corpses are known to transmit Brown Rot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Dark books
necromancy.15.d;Most of the knowledge I seek isn't exactly accessible to the first mage who wants it. It tends to be hidden in subtext, or too cryptic to be clearly understood. The last couple of books I managed to get on Necromancy have been a pain the understand, and I am starting to give up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.15.optA;It might be better to do something else for a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_DARK_BOOKS_SLOWLY_SUCCESS_CT;Success, as staying away from these difficult books gave you some time to perform a couple experiment and learn other things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_DARK_BOOKS_SLOWLY_FAILURE_CT;Failure, but you merely wasted your time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.15.optB;I *need* to understand what these books say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_DARK_BOOKS_PRESS_SUCCESS_CT;Success, you manage to understand the secrets hidden deep within the books!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_DARK_BOOKS_PRESS_FAILURE_CT;Failure, and you fear the time spent figuratively hitting your face against a wall did more ill than good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.15.optC;There are a lot of mages in the Guild, surely one can help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.16.d.1;Taking some time away from the books helped a lot. Between some experiments, a couple days for myself, and a clear view on what the books say, I managed to learn some things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.16.d.2;The days away from the books haven't really helped. I think I hit the current limit for what I can do without more theoretical knowledge, and one day I will need to understand what they say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.16.d.3;After days, and nights, spent trying to decipher the books, I think I finally unlocked their meaning! A ton of new knowledge is ripe for the taking, and I am ever closer to mastering the Dark Arts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.16.d.4;No matter how much time I spent on these books I can't understand any part of the stuff they are saying. I feel like I spent months on this already, while it has only been some days... Maybe I'm just not as smart as I thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.16.d.5;The Guild owns a great deal of books, covering huge parts of our current knowledge about magicka and the arts surrounding it. Luckily, I found a couple books explaining in great details the Necromantic Arts, and with the help of a few like-minded students I was able to replicate most of the experiments written down in the books.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.16.d.6;Our Guild owns a lot of books. Too many of them, in fact, to be able to find anything useful on Necromancy. And the few books I was able to find were either too complicated, or too cryptic to be understood. I'll just have to find another way to learn the Dark Arts...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.17.d;The last few days were probably crucial in my learnings of the Dark Arts, as some difficult part of the theories around the reanimation of the dead and some failed experiments were swept away due to successful practice and clearer understanding of the Necromantic Arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.18.d;There could be many reasons, a lack of motivation, a sudden disinterest in Necromancy, or a lack of energy, but the last few weeks have not be productive. Not at all. You spent most of your time outside your laboratory, and some books even seem to be slowly covered in cobwebs.\n\nHopefully you'll get back to work soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# A final test...
necromancy.50.t;A final test;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.50.d;For the past couple of months you have been studying the Dark Arts of Necromancy. Many became mad, struck bad deals with higher powers, or died in their studies. But not you. Through intense work and talent, you manage to be on the verge of unlocking your full potential as a Necromancer.\n\nBut one last challenge awaits. A true Necromancer can raise and command countless undeads, fresh or not. You have collected dozen of corpses, some to be turned into zombies, other into skeletons, and the rest in various other forms of undead. To complete your studies, you will have to prepare, raise, and control them all.\n\nIf you fail, you will have to keep studying for a while before trying once more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.50.optA;I am ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_FINAL_SUCCESS_CT;A total success. Your potential as a Necromancer would be fully unlocked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NECROMANCY_STUDYING_LEARNING_DARK_FINAL_SETBACK_CT;A major setback will force you to start over...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.51.d.1;After days and night and practice, it is done. You have successfully brought back from the underworld dozens of corpses, and binded them to your will. It has been a long journey, but you can be proud of yourself.\n\nYou are now a master of the Dark Arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.51.d.2;While you have spent many weeks carefully binding one corpse to your will, or studying the theory behind the Dark Arts, it seems you do not currently have what it takes to truly use the powers of the Necromancer. Your efforts were not enough, and you failed in your attempt to raise so many corpses at once. You will have to try again later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.51.optA;Finally. The dead are at my command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.51.optB;Curses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy_studies_finished_success;You will need a couple of days or weeks to compile your studies and clean up your laboratory and library. Once it is done, you will become a fully fledged Necromancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.51.optA;Finally. The dead are at my command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy_studies_finished_success;You will need a couple of days or weeks to compile your studies and clean up your laboratory and library. Once it is done, you will become a fully fledged Necromancer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
## Necromantic Charge
gives_necromantic_charge;Gives an additional §YNecromantic Charge§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CALCULATE_RISEN_DEAD_ARMIES_CT;The number of currently raised Risen Dead armies is refreshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.100.d;As a Necromancer you have the ability to command the dead. Countless tales speak of entire armies returned from the outer-planes but every true necromancer knows, the more dead they raise, the greater the toll upon their own life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.100.optA;The dead will follow my command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromantic_charges_ct;Each Necromancer has a pool of Necromantic power called §YNecromantic Charges§!. Every §Y10 Learning§! gives §Y1 Necromantic Charges§!, and artifacts, wonders, or other sources of Necromantic power can grant a §YNecromantic Charge§! - often at a price...\nEach §YNecromantic Charge§! allows you to summon and command a §YRisen Dead army§!. But be wary, if you try to command more undead than what your necromancer powers allow, some will crumble to dust...\n\nNecromantic Charges are updated once per 30 days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.102.d;Your powers as a Necromancer aren't unlimited, and you cannot control as many dead as you could wish. As such, some will leave your command... But luckily, they will simply return to dust, unable to threaten anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.102.optA;So much potential wasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.103.d;Only landed Necromancers can command Risen Dead troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.103.optA;Well ain't it awkward;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
raise_risen_dead_army;Raise a Risen Dead army;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
raise_risen_dead_army_desc;Use a Necromantic Charge to summon a Risen Dead army, who can fight and crush any enemy you would encounter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

## Corrupt an artifact
corrupt_artifact;Corrupt an artifact;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
corrupt_artifact_desc;There is a lot of power to be found in magical artifacts. But if one wishes to truly assert their dominion over the undeath, they need to corrupt these artifacts, sacrificing a portion of their health and sanity in the process...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_ARTIFACT_2_YEARS_COOLDOWN_CT;Can only try to corrupt an artifact every §Ytwo years§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_ARTIFACT_HAS_RING_TO_CORRUPT_CT;Has a §Ynon-unique§! Ring with a quality §Yequal or inferior to 4§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_ARTIFACT_HAS_AMULET_TO_CORRUPT_CT;Has a §Ynon-unique§! Amulet with a quality §Yequal or inferior to 4§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_ARTIFACT_EFFECT_CT;You will try to corrupt one of your artifacts, or buy a low quality one and corrupt it instead...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.200.d;Traditionally, Necromancers used Rings and Amulets to focus their power and manipulate the dead. Such artifacts however cursed their owner, absorbing a part of their life force and sanity over time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.200.optA;I will corrupt a ring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_RING_CT;You will attempt to corrupt a non-unique §YRing§!. If you don't have one, you will be able to spend money to buy one on the local market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.200.optB;An amulet is what I need...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_AMULET_CT;You will attempt to corrupt a non-unique §YAmulet§!. If you don't have one, you will be able to spend money to buy one on the local market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.200.optC;This might not be a wise idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.201.d;Not all artifacts are made equal. Magical artifacts tend to hold more power, but they tend to resist attempts of corruption. Non-magical ones can hold less power, but they tend to put less resistance against a Necromancer's powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPTION_QUALITY_PLUS_PLUS_CT;This will §Ggreatly improve§! the quality of the resulting artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPTION_QUALITY_PLUS_CT;This will §Gimprove§! the quality of the resulting artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPTION_QUALITY_MINUS_CT;This will §Rlower§! the quality of the resulting artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPTION_QUALITY_NO_CHANGE_CT;This will have a §Ynegligeable impact§! on the quality of the resulting artifact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.201.optA;My [artifact_to_be_corrupted_1.GetName] could hold a part of my powers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.201.optB;My [artifact_to_be_corrupted_2.GetName] could hold a part of my powers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.201.optC;I should corrupt one of my non-equipped artifacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.201.optD;I should buy an artifact on the local market.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CORRUPT_ARTIFACT_BUY_CT;While artifacts on the market tend to be of much lower quality, they can be used should you wish to keep your current ones. And who knows, maybe you will find one perfectly suited for your needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.202.d;There are other artifacts I can claim as my own. Which one should I try to corrupt?\n\n(Should you have more than 3 artifacts that can be corrupted, you can reroll them using the fourth option, if it is available.);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.202.optA;I should use my [artifact_to_be_corrupted_1.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.202.optB;I should use my [artifact_to_be_corrupted_2.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.202.optC;I should use my [artifact_to_be_corrupted_3.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.202.optD;I still have more artifacts I could use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.203.d;While artifacts on the market tend to be of much lower quality, they can be used should you wish to keep your current ones. And who knows, maybe you will find one perfectly suited for your needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.203.optA;A mundane ring should be enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.203.optB;This ring seems to hold some magical power...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.203.optC;This one might be expensive, but also very powerful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.204.d;Corrupting an artifact is no easy task. If the artifact has no magical nature, the mage has to force [Root.GetHerHis] way through, but will not face much resistance, while if it already has magical powers, they must first be forcefully extracted but putting the mage's own life force will be easier. But no matter the method, it will extract a heavy toll on a mage's soul and body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.204.optA;It won't be the most efficient, but I must stay safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
corruption_ritual_health_tribute_minor;Health tribute - Minor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
corruption_ritual_health_tribute_minor_desc;[Root.GetFirstName] traded a small part of [Root.GetHerHis] lifeforce in some dark ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

corruption_ritual_health_tribute_medium;Health tribute - Medium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
corruption_ritual_health_tribute_medium_desc;[Root.GetFirstName] traded some of [Root.GetHerHis] lifeforce in some dark ritual. While it may not inflict serious damage, it still will hamper [Root.GetHerHis] day-to-day life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.204.optC;My soul is nothing compared to the power over the undead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

corruption_ritual_health_tribute_major_desc;[Root.GetFirstName] decided to sacrifice a significant part of [Root.GetHerHis] lifeforce in a dark ritual. This will have long-lasting effects, as no one can truly recover from such an exchange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.205.d;Rumors of my "experiments" have reached the ears of other practitioners of the Dark Arts. One of them joined me today, offering his services and expertise. All he requires in exchange is a handful of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.205.optA;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.205.optB;Begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.206.d;While I expected my body to suffer, I didn't expect the cost to be as high as it is. I cannot rest properly, my soul is constantly tormented, and my body cannot hold for much longer. I should take a break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.206.optA;I must rest. The ritual will have to wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.206.optB;I might slow down, but I cannot stop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.206.optC;This simply means I'm doing the right thing! I must press forward!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.207.d;The art of creating a dark artifact has been known for ages, but rituals tend to come and go as their popularity and efficiency get shadowed by new ways of corrupting magical relics. But the first rituals, while already straining the body and the soul, also required a more... Physical sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.207.optA;That won't be necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.207.optB;A small sacrifice, maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.207.optC;Everything for the Dark Arts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.210.d;Tonight is the final night of the ritual. What took weeks to accomplish is finally over. You can finally rest, but the toll the corruption required won't go away that easily...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.210.optA;W-Where is it?! Why is there nothing??;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.210.optB;I guess this will have to make due...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.210.optC;It holds a fraction of my power...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.210.optD;I can feel its dark power from here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
necromancy.210.optE;A masterpiece!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
