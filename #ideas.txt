colour scheme for targeted decisions:

debug mode (on self):         §R red              looks bad                             legibility 2/5
enable/disable mod (on self): §P pink             looks bad                             legibility 3/5

mods with only 1-2 decisions: §M light yellow     looks good                            legibility 5/5

mods with many decisions:     §l bright green     looks good                            legibility 3/5
                              §L light brown      looks similar to light grey           legibility 3/5
							  §B blue             looks awful                           legibility 4/5
							  §g light grey       looks similar to light brown          legibility 3/5
                              §Y yellow           looks similar to light yellow

Also, add mod reference (eg. ED-EP:) in the decision name
