[b][u]I am temporarily unable to update this mod due to a bug in Steam Workshop. In the meantime, if you want the latest version, you can download it in [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/ck2_mods/blob/master/expanded_decisions_propagate_bloodlines/packaged_mod/expanded_decisions_propagate_bloodlines.zip]zip format[/url].[/u][/b]

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
In vanilla CK2, bloodlines are not always inherited properly. [i](Eg. If you create a bloodline after your daughter's matri-married husband has died then your daughter's children will not get the new bloodline.)[/i]

This mod adds a player-only targeted decision which attempts to re-propagate all bloodlines owned by the targeted character according to each bloodline's inheritance rules. In other words: Characters who should have been part of a bloodline but weren't for some reason, will gain that bloodline.

Unfortunately, it's not possible to do this perfectly in all possible situations (because the CK2 scripting language is [u]extremely[/u] limited in what you can do with bloodlines), so the bloodline propagation logic might occasionally add the wrong people to a bloodline - especially for modded bloodlines. [b][u]This cannot be undone - backup saves are recommended![/u][/b] The mod also includes extensive debugging tools (via self-targeted decisions) in case the user wishes to try to diagnose any issues.

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
