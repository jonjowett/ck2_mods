[b][u]I am temporarily unable to update this mod due to a bug in Steam Workshop. In the meantime, if you want the latest version, you can download it in [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/ck2_mods/blob/master/expanded_decisions_kingdom_formation/packaged_mod/expanded_decisions_kingdom_formation.zip]zip format[/url].[/u][/b]

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod adds intrigue menu decisions which allow you to form several interesting duchies/kingdoms, usually on islands. Depending on the state of the game at the time, the newly-formed title may be "ripped out" of its existing de jure empire/kingdom/duchy and placed into a more appropriate one.

The intended purpose of this mod is to allow players to form overseas naval bases, eg. as raiding centres and/or vassal merchant republics, without having to worry about potential future de jure issues.

[u]Formable kingdoms (from a single duchy):[/u] Crete, Cyprus, Gotland, Iceland, Mallorca, Mann, Taurica (Cherson), Trinacria (Sicily)

[u]Formable duchies (from a single county):[/u] Canarias, Malta, Rhodes

[u]Other notable features:[/u] Reform 769 Saxony (Irminsul flag); Move certain duchies into different de jure kingdoms; Create custom empire by merging kingdoms

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list][*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game:
[list][*]If any [u]mod-added[/u] kingdom (eg. Crete) has been formed at any time in the game's history: [b][u]No[/u][/b]
[*]Otherwise: Yes[/list]
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Compatible with any mod which doesn't alter the map layout
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: Minor
[list][*][i]AI can also take these kingdom formation decisions (but they usually won't, due to the restrictions)[/i][/list]
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: In progress
[list]
[*][i]Expect new formable kingdoms/duchies to be added in the future (notably: Socotra)[/i]
[*][i]If you have specific requests, please comment below, and I will consider including them. (No guarantees, but I'm more likely to accept cool/thematic kingdoms which already exist in the history files, and those which have good-looking flags.)[/i]
[*][i]Otherwise, I'll add new formable kingdoms/duchies depending on my own personal games and inclination.[/i]
[*][i]Eventually, I plan to make it [u]optional[/u] to de jure move formed kingdoms into your current empire.[/i]

[h1]Details:[/h1]

[u]Kingdom formation (from a single duchy):[/u]
[list]
[*]Requirements:
[list]
[*]You must be independent, adult, at peace, and not incapable
[*]You must have 1000 prestige (which [u]will not[/u] be removed)
[*]You must have 300 gold and 400 piety (which [u]will[/u] be removed)
[*]The new kingdom must be titular and have no current holder
[list][*][i](IE: It must not have been formed previously)[/i][/list]
[*]You (or your vassals) must own the duchy title and every holding in the "stem duchy" of the new kingdom
[list][*][i](Eg: For the kingdom of Cyprus, you must own the duchy of Cyprus and every holding in that duchy)[/i][/list]
[*]You must not be de jure liege of the new kingdom
[list][*][i](Eg: The Byzantine emperor cannot form the kingdom of Cyprus, because he is already de jure liege of the duchy of Cyprus)[/i][/list]
[*]You (or your vassals) must not own or control other duchies in the same de jure kingdom
[list][*][i](Because, if you do, you should probably be trying to form that de jure kingdom)[/i][/list]
[/list]
[*]Actions that occur on kingdom formation:
[list]
[*]The kingdom title is created and granted to the character taking the decision
[*]The "stem duchy" becomes de jure part of the new kingdom
[*]If the character taking the decision is an emperor, the new kingdom becomes de jure part of their primary empire title
[*]Gold & piety is deducted
[/list]
[*]Formable kingdoms:
[list]
[*]Repurposed vanilla kingdoms: Cyprus, Taurica (Cherson), Trinacria (Sicily)
[*]New kingdoms added by this mod: Crete, Gotland, Iceland, Mallorca, Mann
[/list]
[/list]

[u]Duchy formation (from a single county):[/u]
[list]
[*]Requirements (very similar to kingdom formation above):
[list]
[*]You must be independent, adult, at peace, and not incapable
[*]You must have 300 prestige (which [u]will not[/u] be removed)
[*]You must have 150 gold and 100 piety (which [u]will[/u] be removed)
[*]The new duchy must be titular and have no current holder
[*]You (or your vassals) must own the county title and every holding in the "stem county" of the new duchy
[*]You must not be de jure liege of the "stem county"
[*]You (or your vassals) must not own or control any other counties in the same de jure duchy as the "stem county"
[/list]
[*]Actions that occur on kingdom formation:
[list]
[*]The duchy title is created and granted to the character taking the decision
[*]The "stem county" becomes de jure part of the new duchy
[*]The "stem county" remains de jure part of the same kingdom as before, because the new duchy is de jure added to that kingdom
[*]Gold & piety is deducted
[/list]
[*]Formable duchies:
[list]
[*]Repurposed vanilla duchies: None
[*]New duchies added by this mod: Canarias, Malta, Rhodes
[/list]
[/list]

[u]Additional special decisions:[/u]
[list]
[*]Reform the 769 kingdom of Saxony (Irminsul flag)
[list]
[*]Requirements: Similar to the vanilla decision to form the Grand Duchy of Saxony, except you must be independent.
[*]On kingdom formation: 769 Saxony is reformed and granted to the character, and all relevant duchies are migrated into it.
[/list]
[*]De jure merge a formable duchy into a different kingdom:
[list]
[*]Requirements: Own (or have a vassal own) both the formable duchy and the formable kingdom
[*]On duchy merge: The formable duchy is removed from its previous de jure kingdom and becomes de jure part of the other kingdom
[*]Supported duchy merges: Crete->Cyprus, Rhodes->Cyprus, Mallorca->Sardinia & Corsica
[/list]
[*]Form an empire by merging multiple kingdoms
[list]
[*]Requirements:
[list]
[*]Similar to the vanilla decision to create a custom empire (Charlemagne DLC), except that de jure migration only requires every county to be owned (not every barony)
[*]Must be a king (not an emperor) and must have Charlemagne DLC active (per Paradox policy)
[/list]
[*]On empire formation:
[list]
[*]For every kingdom that is fully owned/controlled by the character down to county level: de jure merge it into the new empire and then destroy it.
[*]The new empire has the same laws and coat of arms as the previous primary kingdom.
