[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This micro-mod relaxes the cultural requirement for characters to take the "Delve into the Classics" decision (which can eventually allow you to revive the Hellenic faith).

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier (unless doing so makes the game significantly more fun).
[list][*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: AI can also take the modded decision, if they are eligible
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Negligible
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Functionally complete, but I'm open to changing the list of cultures if there's a good reason to do so[/list]

[h1]Details:[/h1]
This mod adds a new decision which permits characters to start the vanilla "Delve into the Classics" event chain if:

[*]They belong to one of the following [u]post-Roman[/u] cultures:
[list][*]Latin culture group
[*]Byzantine culture group, except Alan and Assyrian
[*]Iberian culture group, except Basque
[*]English
[*]Anglo-Saxon
[*]Dutch[/list][/list]
