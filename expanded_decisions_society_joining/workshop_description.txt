[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod makes it [u]slightly[/u] easier for [u]non-zealous[/u] characters to join warrior lodges and the Hermetics.

Additional options that allow a character to join a warrior lodge:
[list]
[*]If they could in theory: pause, convert to the warrior lodge's religion, join the society, convert back to their previous religion, unpause
[list][*][i](This process, possible in achievement-compatible vanilla, may alter the player's succession laws. The ability to join directly via this mod means succession laws are unaffected.)[/i][/list]
[*]Has an active bloodline that was founded by a legendary journey from that warrior lodge
[*]Has an active bloodline that is "respected" by the warrior lodge
[/list]

Additional options that allow a character to join the Hermetic Society:
[list]
[*]If they could in theory: pause, convert to a religion that allows the Hermetics, join the society, convert back to their previous religion, unpause.
[*]Tribal and nomadic rulers (who cannot join the Hermetics in the base game) can join via this mod if they have decent learning stat and one or more pre-existing "hermetic things" (hermetic bloodline, major hermetic artifact, scholarly lifestyle, observatory).
[/list]

Other features:
[list]
[*]Warrior lodge legendary bloodlines are now awarded according to your character's traits/achievements/etc, and you will only receive a duplicate bloodline type if there are no other options.
[*]AI characters with legendary warrior lodge or hermetic bloodlines are likely to join the relevant societies.
