[h1]Summary:[/h1]
In the base game, the Grand Hunt is blocked for all women, and for men who have any type of health condition - which includes relatively-benign conditions such as lunacy and being a eunuch.

This mod adds a new Grand Hunt decision, which allows all characters (male and female) to go on a Grand Hunt, as long as they don't have any debilitating health conditions.

Conditions that are considered debilitating are:
[list]
[*]Any type of illness
[*]Wounded or severely injured
[*]Infirm, mangled, maimed or incapable
[*]In a regency (ie. something else is preventing the ruler from taking normal actions)
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list]
[*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*]Changes to vanilla files:
[list][*]Alters ...\events\hunting_events.txt, to allow these vanilla Grand Hunt events to occur if a character has non-debilitating health conditions.[/list]
[*]Mod compatibility:
[list][*]Compatible with any mod that does not alter the vanilla Grand Hunt events (...\events\hunting_events.txt)[/list]
[*]Changes to AI behaviour:
[list][*]AI can take the new decision, if they fulfil the criteria. I don't know if they actually take it, and it probably doesn't make much difference either way.[/list]
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Negligible
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Mostly-complete, but desired future developments are impractical:
[list][*]Ideally, a character who ONLY has non-epidemic syphilis ("Great Pox") and/or cancer shouldn't be blocked. But this seems impossible without hardcoding a massive list of traits, which would also break compatibility with mods that add new health conditions.[/list]
