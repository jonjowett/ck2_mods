[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod adds new decisions which expand the scope of various targeted decisions in the vanilla game:
[list]
[*][u]Make Horoscope:[/u] Can make a horoscope for any close relative or descendant (instead of only your children)
[*][u]Make Shieldmaiden:[/u] Can make any female close relative or descendant or dynastic warrior lodge member into a shieldmaiden (instead of only your sisters/daughters)
[*][u]Make Shieldmaiden (self):[/u] Female warrior lodge members (including AI) can declare themselves to be shieldmaidens (not possible in vanilla)
[*][u]Send away as Mercenary:[/u] Can "send away as mercenary": any close relative, any descendant, any dynastic shieldmaiden, and any dynast who is nomadic or has the appropriate bloodline feature (instead of only your children)
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
