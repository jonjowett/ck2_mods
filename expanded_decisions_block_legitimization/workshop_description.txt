[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This micro-mod adds player-only targeted decisions which allow you to temporarily block/re-enable the "legitimise child" interaction. (Because it's surprisingly easy to accidentally mis-click, and legitimisation cannot be undone.)

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
