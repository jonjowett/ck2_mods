namespace = ExpdPdxrptgRingOfHappiness

# If a character has the ring of happiness equipped and STILL manages to acquire stressed/depressed somehow,
#    then remove stressed/depressed automatically within approx 4 months.

# If a character equips the ring of happiness AFTER aquiring stressed/depressed,
#    then remove stressed/depressed within at most 2 years 4 months.
# This distinction is because I can't be bothered to write separate logic to handle this scenario:
#    2 years is the maximum interval between yearly pulses + 4 months is the max time before the first possible removal

# If a character has stressed/depressed removed by these events, and later unequips the ring,
#    there is a chance that stressed/depressed is re-applied.
#    IE: They have become dependent on the ring to protect them from stress.

# This feature is *deliberately* applied to everyone who has the ring equipped - which may include unlanded AI.
#    IE: We cannot use any pre-filters in these events.
#    NB: AI are treated as having the ring equipped as long as they have it in their inventory - they don't have to actually equip it.
