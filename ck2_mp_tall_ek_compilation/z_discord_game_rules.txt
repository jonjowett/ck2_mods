.
Main Rules
.
(1) No PVP of any sort without mutual consent (preferably in writing in chat):
This includes hostile actions against characters: dynasty members, courtiers, councillors, commanders, etc.
Bringing other players' dynasty members/courtiers/etc to your court (eg. via invitation, concubinage, etc) is also forbidden.
If a player character is being handled by AI due to player absence (see rule 2) then they / their dynasty / etc are still protected for the purpose of this rule.
Hostile magic of any sort counts as PVP, and requires mutual consent. War is a special case:
If you are at war with another player, you may only use hostile magic if it was agreed upon in advance. (And only within the limits you agreed - eg. "no firestorm, grand healing, or hostile magic on individual characters")
Once you give consent for hostile war magic, it may not be withdrawn for the duration of the war. (Except if, in extreme circumstances, the host steps in to ban hostile magic for both players.)
Exception: You may attack other players' tributaries without mutual consent (see rule 7).
 
.
(2) Scheduling & Attendance:
Schedule:
Sessions will usually occur on Sunday evenings, at 19:00 (time adjusts to your locale) (see also the server's "Event" list).
Ad-hoc sessions and/or scheduling changes will be announced at least 24h in advance.
Cancellation:
If one-third of current players say they will NOT attend a session by 24h beforehand, then the session will be cancelled.
If only one person attends (aside from the host, ie. 2 players in total), then the session will be cancelled.
Otherwise, the session will go ahead as planned.
Player lateness:
We aim to start playing within 20 minutes of the scheduled session start.
If you are having technical problems which are causing delays on your end, talk to us in voice or text chat, and give us regular updates every 2-3 minutes.
If you are late and uncommunicative, we will start without you.
Player absence:
Any player characters who are not present will be played by AI.
AI stupidity during player absence will be reverted by save edit, if possible. (NB: Death is not reversible. However, for immortals, we may try to prevent their death via rehost.)
 
.
(3) Setup:
Mod list:
Base mod: PDXRP Tamriel Game
Expansion: (Not yet published)
You may include any other mod which doesn't change the checksum (eg. Better Character Tooltips)
Checksum: (TBC)
You must verify that you have the correct checksum significantly in advance of the game.
If you have problems, we will try to help, but we will not delay the game for you.
You must download the save file and put it in the correct location before joining the MP lobby.
The "correct location" is usually: C:\Users{username}\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\EK021\save games\
 
.
(4) During a session:
Follow the ⁠general-rules
Voice chat:
Listening to VC is required; speaking is not. (Rationale: Some people don't have a microphone and/or are uncomfortable with speaking, but discussions/explanations/announcements usually occur in VC, so it's important to stay informed.)
If your microphone is on, please take steps (eg. headphones, push-to-talk, moving to a quiet room) to mitigate background noise (eg. game audio, TV, your family talking).
Follow the music bot rules.
Pausing:
We have a few minutes paused at the start of each session. (Rationale: So you can get reacquainted with your situation.)
Only pause the game if it's truly necessary, and explain in text or voice chat.
Rehosts:
We aim to avoid mid-session rehosts unless they are absolutely necessary (eg. game crash, urgent save edit). (Rationale: Each rehost takes 20-30 minutes, which we could otherwise have spent playing the game.)
If a rehost occurs, please try to join as quickly as possible, to minimise downtime.
Departure:
If you're leaving early, while the session is ongoing, please let us know in voice or text chat before you leave. (Rationale: So we don't waste time, and so the host can keep an eye on your character.)

(5) Spheres of influence:
Players have defined spheres of influence (either a few de jure duchies, or a few specific counties).
If you own or tributise territory in another player's "sphere of influence", you must give it up on request.
If you can't use in-game methods to give up the territory, for some reason, it can be done via save edit between sessions.
Players may voluntarily give up parts of their "sphere of influence" (eg. in exchange for concessions from another player).
List of "Spheres of Influence":
(TBD)
 
.
(6) "Playing tall" / Realm size cap
Your realm size will be automatically calculated by the game, every year.
Similarly, any penalties will be automatically applied, every year.
For tribal/nomad governments, the total number of empty holding slots in your realm is added to the normal in-game realm size.
(Rationale: These governments receive significant benefits from empty holding slots.)
For every 1 over the current realm size limit, you will receive the following penalty:
-1 to all stats
-5 Personal Combat Skill
-2 general opinion (NB: Low vassal opinion decreases levies and taxes)
+0.2% global revolt risk (NB: We will have no sympathy if you deliberately exceed the cap and get destroyed by provincial revolts)
-x% retinue size (x is TBD)
-y% levy size (y is TBD)
The "Grant Independence" game rule will be set to "Unrestricted"
(Rationale: You can always reduce your realm size by giving away land.)
The "Exclave Independence" game rule will be set to "Harsh"
(Rationale: Mitigate AI bordergore.)
The host will help any players with highly-disconnected inland realms to stay intact.
The realm size cap will be increased periodically during the campaign
Initially, the cap will only be increased if at least 2 players' realm sizes are within 20% of the current cap. (Eg: For a cap of 50, 2 players need to have realm size 40-60.)
This policy will be reviewed and updated as the game progresses.
 
.
(7) Tributaries
It will not usually be possible to directly force tributisation via war.
(Because you would have to have - and maintain indefinitely - larger realm size than the target.)
Instead, "Protectorates" can be gained indirectly as follows:
You must maintain a larger army and/or more prestige than the target (or they'll be able to instantly break free).
Force Protectorate: If you are directly responsible for installing a character as the ruler of an independent realm (eg. grant independence, press claim) then they will accept a "Force Protectorate" offer.
Offer Protectorate: If a ruler close to your borders likes you enough (and/or is threatened by outsiders), they may accept an offer of protection. Friends/lovers/relatives/etc are more likely to accept.
Important features of protectorates:
The protectorate relationship does NOT automatically break on the suzerain's death.
If the suzerain refuses a defensive call to arms, the protectorate will break free. (If your protectorates go to war with each other, side with the defender!)
20% of a protectorate's income and manpower recovery is siphoned to their suzerain.
Every holding in a protectorate grants 5 additional retinue cap to the overlord. (Updates on a random day, once per year.)
You may not protectorise other players, or their AI while they are absent, except with mutual consent.
Player protectorates may break themselves free at any time, without needing to go to war.
AI will not be permitted to protectorise anyone (AI or player).
(But they may create other tributaries as usual.)
You may freely attack other players' protectorates without mutual consent.
(Eg: To take some land from them; or to gain the protectorate for yourself by installing your own claimant.)
Please remember to be nice ( general rule #1 )!

Appendix A: Player Starts
.
(A1) Player starts: Rules:
.
You may either choose a character who already exists in the game at the start, or you may invent your own character.
.
Special rules for "invented" characters:
You may choose any demesne, race, religion, culture, traits, age, base stats, etc - as long as they are in line with generic characters which exist at game start.
Your traits and base stats must follow the same rules as in "Player starts: Optional benefits". (Unless you have a very good reason.)
Race and culture should match. (Unless you have a good RP reason.)
.
Realm size must be less than the realm size cap (currently 50).
When you play as a character, their realm size is stated in the top-right corner of the game window.
For nomads and tribes, you must add all of the empty holding slots in your realm to the default realm size. (Quick approximation: For nomads/tribes, assume each county counts as 4 realm size.)
(Advice: If you have vassal counts, it's probably a good idea to stay slightly under the cap, because they may construct additional holdings.)
(Rationale: So that you don't get "realm size" penalties immediately upon starting the game.)
.
Not too close to another player
(Exception: Starting close to another player may be permitted, after discussion between all involved players and the host.)
(Rationale: This is due to the "no non-consensual PvP" rule - we ALSO don't want players to "squeeze" each other.)
 
jonjowett — 06/09/2025 14:17
.
(A2) Player starts: Optional Benefits:
5k gold
2 uncommon artifacts (tier 1-2, not unique) or 1 rare artifact (tier 3-4, not unique)
Redistribution of base stats (max of 25 base stat points in total)
Specification of traits:
At most 1 of: genius, quick, strong, attractive, brawny, shrewd
At most 1 lifestyle trait (including lifestyle-adjacent, eg. poet)
At most 1 commander trait
Any birthsign trait
Any religious trait, if relevant for your religion (usually named "Follower of X")
At most 5 personality traits (Rationale: In EK, characters with more than 5 traits have them randomly removed, so having more is pointless.)
Any tier-3 education trait (Rationale: Gaining tier-4 is an objective - see B3 below.)
Removal of all serious negative health traits (eg. inbred, eunuch, slow)
Additional benefits will be given to players who join after the first few sessions. (Please discuss with an admin.)

Appendix B: Player Objectives
.
(B1) Player Objectives: Overview
Rewards are classified as "Medium", "Large" or "Huge".
You may freely split and combine rewards: Huge = 2x Large ; Large = 2x Medium.
If you think you have earned a reward, contact the host asap after a session so they can verify and add it to the list of earned rewards (B5, below).
If you want to spend a reward, contact the host asap before the next session to discuss details.
 
.
(B2) Player Objectives: Rewards
.
"Medium" reward examples:
1x tier-5/6 artifact of your choice [1]
2x tier-3/4 artifacts of your choice [1]

1x tier-3/4 and 2x tier-1/2 artifacts of your choice [1]
10k wealth
3 empty holding slots added to your realm, in the counties of your choice
A save edit of your current character's traits (as if they were a new player - see A2) (or you can save-edit some other highly-relevant character, eg: your current heir, or someone you want as your heir)
Inclusion of your character and their descendants in an existing bloodline of your choice (all bloodlines in EK have special relevance in lore - they should not be duplicated)
.
"Large" reward examples:
1x tier-7/8 artifact of your choice [1]
Custom-coded bloodline (similar to most existing bloodlines) [2]
Custom-coded artifact (similar to most existing tier-5/6 artifacts) [2]

Custom-coded bloodline (significantly better than most existing bloodlines) [2]
Custom-coded artifact (similar to most existing tier-7/8 artifacts) [2]

[1] This includes rare and unique artifacts. The only exception is if an artifact is currently owned by a player and can't be duplicated for technical reasons. If possible, choose an artifact related to the objective - eg. wealth-gain for a wealth objective.
[2] Subject to host approval, and to their capacity to make the relevant developments.

Suggestions welcome!

[1] Without save edits or strange inheritance shenanigans - earn it yourself, or educate your heir super-well.
[2] Excluding those that exist at game start.
[3] A "trade zone" is a set of trade posts which is linked together. This usually requires adjacency and/or sea-zone dominance. In trade mapmode, click on a province, and the trade zone will be highlighted in blue.
[4] "Dynastic racial purity" means that you have no living legitimate dynasty members of another race. Checked by the host at the end of each session (eg. via the end-of-session save file). Sessions where you are absent do not count, either way.
[5] "Favoured by X" is a mechanic I have added to EK which allows players to activate daedric artifacts despite not following that daedra's religion. It costs the same as buying the artifact in the first place. Aside from being dragonborn, this is the only way to wield 3+ daedras' artifacts.
[6] If possible, by permanently unlocking their offmap_power interfaces for characters with the bloodline. But there may be technical issues with this (eg. 10 offmap powers might break the interface), so it may have to be a secret-conversion decision.
[7] Compared with game start. Measured via ledger p4.
[8] Excludes event-driven mass conversions, eg. 8->9 divines.
[9] As a MR, you can only achieve this goal if you would have have the relevant trade one even if all of your other trade posts were destroyed.
