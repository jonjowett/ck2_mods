[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This micro-mod allows [u]landed[/u] characters with the "adventurer" trait to forge the base game's "Pure War" and "Murder-War Hybrid" bloodlines. (In the base game, having the "adventurer" trait blocks you from forging any of these bloodlines, which seems like an oversight.)

(This mod also unblocks the war bloodlines for landed characters with the "peasant leader" and "heresiarch" traits, but that's unlikely to ever have any impact.)

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
As with all of my mods, my aim is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
