[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod expands on the vanilla system of tributaries:
[list]
[*]New "Protectorate" tributary:
[list]
[*]If your character directly sets an AI character up in an independent realm (eg. via Crusade or pressing their claim or granting independence), you can force them to become your Protectorate via diplomatic interaction.
[*]If an independent character likes you enough and/or is sufficiently weak/threatened, they may accept your diplomatic offer to become their Protector.
[*]Protectorates can sever the relationship via an intrigue decision if they become stronger and/or more prestigious than their overlord.
[*]Otherwise, Protectorates are identical to permanent tributaries (20% tax, 15% manpower, must be defended).
[/list]
[*]New chainable tributary CBs, allowing you to enforce "extorted" or "permanent" tributary status from any independent realm which neighbours any of your tributaries.
[/list]

The primary aim of this mod is to allow the player to set up a decentralised empire, where only a small portion is directly controlled through vassalage and the rest is simply protected against outside encroachment.
