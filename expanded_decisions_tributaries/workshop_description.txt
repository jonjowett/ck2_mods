[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This mod allows players to set up a decentralised empire, where only a small portion is directly controlled through vassalage, and the rest is simply protected against outside encroachment.

It does this by expanding on the base game's tributary system:
[list]
[*]New "Protectorate" tributary:
[list]
[*]If your character directly sets an AI character up in an independent realm (eg. via Crusade or pressing their claim or granting independence), you can force them to become your Protectorate via diplomatic interaction.
[*]If an independent character likes you enough and/or is sufficiently weak/threatened, they may accept your diplomatic offer to become their Protector.
[*]Protectorates can sever the relationship via an intrigue decision if they become stronger and/or more prestigious than their overlord.
[*]Otherwise, Protectorates are identical to permanent tributaries (20% tax, 15% manpower, must be defended).
[/list]

[*]"Permanent" tributaries and "Protectorates" grant retinue cap to their suzerain, based on their realm size.

[*]Suzerains can convert "Permanent" tributaries into "Protectorates" (and vice versa), via targeted decision on the tributary character.

[*]New chainable CBs:
[list]
[*]You can now enforce "extorted" or "permanent" tributary status from any independent realm which neighbours any of your tributaries.
[*]You can also use the religious liberation CB, against your tributaries' neighbours.
[/list]

[*]Players can directly transfer their vassals to one of their tributaries (via targeted decision on the tributary). (This allows for more aesthetically-pleasing borders!)

[*]Extensive "debug mode" functionality (accessible via self-targeted decision), in case you encounter issues.
[/list]




[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list]
[*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game:
[list]
[*]If any Protectorates exist: No
[*]If no Protectorates exist: Yes
[/list]
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour:
[list]
[*]All of the new decisions are available to AI that fulfil the criteria. So far, they seem to use them appropriately.
[*]Update 6/9/24: AI decision-making has been improved.
[/list]
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Functional but there are more features I'd like to add (eg. declaring war on behalf of a tributary).
[/list]
