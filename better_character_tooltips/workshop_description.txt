[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod allows players to view useful character information (eg. wealth, artifacts, childhood education, health, fertility), without clicking-through to the character's profile, and [u]without changing the checksum[/u]. (IE: Usable in MP & ironman.)

[h1]Features:[/h1]
The following info is added to the character tooltip:
[list]
[*] Character ID number
[*] Childhood traits
[list]
[*] This only matters for Conclave-style education.
[*] Childhood traits are shown even [u]after[/u] the trait has disappeared (ie. has been converted into an adult trait).
[*] This allows you to pick the best possible education for a character, even if you wait a few years after age 12.
[/list]
[*] Approximate wealth
[list]
[*] Categories: <0, 0-50, 50-150, 150-500, 500-2000, >2000
[*] Colour-coded - hot pink is best!
[/list]
[*] Wealth Inheritance
[list]
[*] Effectively: Will you inherit this character's wealth if they mysteriously die while in your court?
[/list]
[*] Artifacts
[list]
[*] Listed by quantity and quality (eg. "1 x Q2, 2 x Q1")
[*] Quality is colour-coded (so better artifacts stand out more)
[*] Supports modded artifacts with quality higher than 5 (quality higher than 8 is grouped into a "9+" category)
[/list]
[*] Invitation blockers
[list]
[*] Notifies you of all parameters which will prevent you from inviting this character to your court.
[*] Colour coded: Yellow = can possibly be worked-around (eg. via favour); Red = probably can't be worked-around.
[/list]
[*] Health
[list]
[*] If health is close to zero (-0.5 to +0.5), accurate to nearest 0.1
[*] If health is very large (>10), only accurate to nearest 0.5
[*] Otherwise, accurate to nearest 0.25
[*] Colour-coded
[/list]
[*] Fertility
[list]
[*] Accurate to to nearest 5%, between -100% and +300%
[*] Colour-coded
[/list]
[/list]

Blank lines:
[list]
[*] A large number of blank lines are added to the top of the tooltip.
[*] The aim of these blank lines is that every piece of information always occurs in the same spatial location, which allows you to:
[list]
[*] Open the character finder and set filters;
[*] Keep your mouse pointer fixed in place, on one character's portrait;
[*] Focus on the tiny area of the screen which contains one thing you care about (eg. fertility);
[*] Scroll through the list using your mousewheel; and
[*] Stop whenever this one piece of info hits a good value (eg. when it's hot pink)
[/list]
[/list]

Finally, I acknowledge that some of the colours used in the colour-coding are horribly garish. However, the CK2 engine doesn't support many different colours; and several of those are not legible on a black tooltip background; and several more are not easily distinguishable. There wasn't a lot of choice!

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list]
[*] Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*] Achievement compatible: Yes!
[*] Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*] Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*] Changes to vanilla files: None
[*] Mod compatibility:
[list]
[*] NOT compatible with mods which alter the CHAR_AGE loc string
[list]
[*] Eg: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1769825310]Visible Health & Fertility[/url]
[*] Will [u]probably[/u] still work properly in conjunction with these mods (by overriding any changes they make to the character tooltip), but actual results are unpredictable - do your own testing!
[/list]
[*] Should be compatible with all other mods
[/list]
[*] Changes to AI behaviour: None
[*] Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*] Localisation: English only
[*] Mod development status: Complete, but I'm open to suggestions for new features
[*] Known bugs/issues:
[list]
[*] "Blank lines" feature "fails" (produces the wrong number of blank lines) for about 1% of characters.
[/list]
