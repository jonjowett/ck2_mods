[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This is an automatically-generated totally-compatible version of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3518850329]main ED:MP mod[/url], which is a utility mod for multiplayer games, intended to help hosts to resolve almost any issue their players may encounter, preferably without even having to pause the game. For fairness and transparency, all of these host actions are automatically announced to every other player.

This mod should be compatible with literally every other CK2 mod (including total conversions). If you find that it is NOT compatible with some other mod, please leave a comment - this is a bug which I will attempt to fix!
