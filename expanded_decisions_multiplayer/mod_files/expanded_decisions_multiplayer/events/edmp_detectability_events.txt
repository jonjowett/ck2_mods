# on_startup & on_yearly_pulse, for SP human or MP host, add a special modifier to province #1, for slightly more than 2 years
#  --- Province #1 must always exist
#  --- If this mod is active in the current game, then this special modifier will definitely be present (because the maximum interval between renewals is 2 years).
#  --- If this mod has NEVER been active in the current game, then this special modifier will definitely NOT be present.
#  --- If this mod was previously active but has since been removed, then one of these two will happen:
#       --- Best case: The special modifier will NOT be present (removed by the game engine because it's not defined).
#       --- Worst case: The special modifier will expire after 2 years of game time, meaning that this mod will be erroneously detected for only a short period of in-game time.
