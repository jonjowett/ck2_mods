	# Rationale:
	#  --- Factions are more likely, Vassals give fewer levies and less tax, characters tend to refuse your requests

	#  --- At  30 stacks:  -60 (very annoying but still potentially manageable)

	#  --- At  10 stacks:  -20% (annoying but manageable)
	#  --- At  30 stacks:  -60% (very annoying but still potentially manageable)
