[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This micro-mod does exactly what it says on the tin: All AI reformed pagans will now try to convert their provinces.

Specifically:
[list]
[*] In the base game, AI reformed pagans make different choices for province conversion based on:
[list]
[*]The Nature of their religion;
[*]Whether they are zealous; and
[*]Whether the province is also pagan.
[/list]

[*] Now, none of this matters: AI reformed pagans will [u]always[/u] send their court chaplain to convert provinces of different religion.
[list]
[*] This means it is now as convenient to build a large reformed pagan empire as it is to build a large empire of any other religion - you don't have to manually send your court chaplain to convert Every. Single. Province.
[/list]

[*] Nothing else has been altered.
[/list]
