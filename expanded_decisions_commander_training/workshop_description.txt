[h1]Summary:[/h1]

The main feature of this mod is that you can [u]pay[/u] for your Marshal and Chinese Strategist to train a [u]specific[/u] commander, once every few years.

You can also ask them to train your character (which is not possible in the base game).

And there are a number of smaller improvements to the whole process of commander training (see below).




[h1]Details:[/h1]

[h3]Ad-hoc training:[/h3]

This is done by targeted decision (right-click interaction menu) on the trainee.

[u]Cost:[/u]
[list]
[*] For the Marshal training, you have to give them a favor (or a favor you have on them will be cancelled).
[list][*] [i](If you don't have Conclave DLC, you instead have to pay an amount of gold equivalent to buying a favor.)[/i][/list]
[*] For the Chinese Strategist training, the payment is 200 Grace
[list][*] [i](For a Golden Age Strategist, the cost is only 100 - following the base game's pattern of Golden Age courtiers being twice as effective.)[/i][/list]
[*] If you ask them to train your character, there is an additional large prestige cost.
[/list]

[u]Cooldown:[/u]
[list]
[*] For the Marshal training, the cooldown is based on the Marshal's martial stat.
[list][*] [i](Higher stat means shorter cooldown.)[/i][/list]
[*] For the Chinese Strategist training, the cooldown is based on the number of Strategists in your court.
[list][*] [i](More strategists means shorter cooldown.)[/i][/list]
[*] Cooldowns are attached to the ruler who asks for the training.
[list][*] [i](Firing your Marshal won't help - you can only reset the cooldown by dying...)[/i][/list]
[/list]

[u]Limits:[/u]
[list]
[*] You cannot exceed the base game's limits on commander training:
[list]
[*] {2 conventional + 1 Chinese} or {1 conventional + 2 Chinese} commander traits
[*] Marshal training will not increase a trainee's martial stat if it is already 20+
[/list][/list]

[u]AI:[/u]
[list]
[*] AI rulers can and will use this feature, in appropriate circumstances.
[*] AI rulers who take the Marshal training decision will pay gold instead of transferring favors.
[list][*] [i](Because writing logic to correctly evaluate whether an AI should give/use a favor would be unbelievably difficult.)[/i][/list]
[/list]

[h3]Trait selection:[/h3]

While the specific trait received by the trainee is still random, it should be a bit more sensible:
[list]
[*] It was previously completely random; now there are weightings based on the trainer's and trainee's existing traits.
[list][*] [i](Eg: If the trainer is a Defender and the trainee is Patient then the trainee is very likely to become a Defender.)[/i][/list]
[*] The trainee is slightly more likely to get a complimentary trait.
[list][*] [i](Eg: A Siege Leader is more likely to get Way of the Leopard.)[/i][/list]
[*] The trainee will [u]not[/u] get an opposing trait.
[list][*] [i](Eg: A Winter Leader will not get Flanker.)[/i][/list]
[*] This applies to both the ad-hoc training (see above) and the base game's random training events.
[/list]

[h3]Frequency of random training:[/h3]

For the base game's free random training events, the MTTH calculation has been slightly revamped.

Having a Marshal with a martial stat above 23 means that the event will occur more often.
[list]
[*] In the base game, having a Marshal with martial 22+ meant the event would occur on average every ~40 months. (Higher martial stat had no impact.)
[*] With this mod, having a Marshal with martial stat over 22 leads to further increases in event frequency. The effect now caps at martial 40, with the event occurring on average every ~28 months.
[/list]

Having two or three Chinese Strategists in your court makes the event twice or three times as likely to occur.
[list]
[*] This event is formulated as a random choice on the offmap pulse.
[*] So, its expected frequency depends on the total number of offmap-pulse events you qualify for at any given time - it's not an easy-to-calculate constant (unlike the Marshal training).
[/list]




[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.

[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility:
[list]
[*]In general, this mod should be compatible with all other mods.
[*]The only exception is if the other mod [u]also[/u] modifies one of the random commander training events (MNM.70010, MNM.70011, JD.20041).
[/list]
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: Minor
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
