expd_ct_block_chinese_training_desc;[Root.GetBestName] has recently asked [Root.GetHerHis] Chinese strategist to train a specific commander.\n\nHowever, Chinese strategists have an unusual amount of autonomy, due to their ties with their homeland, and they begrudge this kind of direct interference with their duties. [Root.GetBestName] will have to wait a while before making another such request.\n\n§g(This modifier was added by a targeted decision included in the §MED-CT§g mod. The duration is reduced by having multiple strategists, and by having a Golden Age strategist.)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

expd_ct_block_marshal_training_desc;[Root.GetBestName] has recently asked [Root.GetHerHis] Marshal to train a specific commander.\n\nHowever, Marshals can only perform a limited amount of additional training over and above their regular duties, so [Root.GetBestName] will have to wait a while before making another such request.\n\n§g(This modifier was added by a targeted decision included in the §MED-CT§g mod. The duration is reduced by having a Marshal with higher martial skill.)§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
