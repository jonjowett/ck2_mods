[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod adds settlement decisions which allow player characters who are tribal or nomad to pillage settlements a little bit more easily.

Specifically:
[list]
[*]Tribal characters can pillage tribal holdings.
[*]Tribal characters can pillage the final holding in the province.
[*]Tribal and nomad characters can [u]instantly[/u] pillage holdings, but this costs piety.
[/list]

Most of this is possible in achievment-compatible vanilla via exploits, so it doesn't actually make the game significantly easier. (Except that it significantly decreases the number of mouseclicks required.)

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list]
[*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game: Yes
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: None [u]for now[/u] (see mod development)
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Mostly complete
[list][*]The logic that would allow the AI to properly use these decisions has not yet been finalised. In practice, this means tribal/nomadic players may get a lot of popup events after a war, prompting them to full-pillage a newly-conquered holding. These popup events may not work properly - consider dismissing them and using the settlement decisions instead.[/list]
