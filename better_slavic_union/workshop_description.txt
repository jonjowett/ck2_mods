[h1]Summary:[/h1]

The aim of this mod is to offer a more interesting experience for rulers who form the Slavic Union. Effectively, this modded version of the Slavic Union will become a large tolerant multi-cultural empire in Eastern Europe.

[h1]Features:[/h1]

[u]Accepted cultures & religions:[/u]
[list][*]West/East Slavic culture and Slavic paganism are "accepted" by default
[*]Additional cultures and religions can become "accepted", eg. by conquering specified areas or by vassalising heads of religion.
[*]The "accepted" status of the emperor's and province owner's and province's culture is assessed:
[list][*]If they are all some kind of "accepted": revolt risk is greatly reduced
[*]If they are identical but not "accepted": no impact
[*]If they are non-identical and not "accepted": revolt risk is increased (possibly greatly increased, if there are multiple issues)
[/list]
[*]The same logic is used for religion
[*]On taking the decision to "accept" a culture/religion, the emperor founds a bloodline which grants small opinion bonuses from characters of that culture/religion.
[/list]

[u]Cultural and de jure expansion:[/u]
[list][*]Conquering specified kingdoms moves them [i]de jure[/i] into the Slavic Union and grants "acceptance":
[list][*]Kingdom of Pomerania: [i](No additional "acceptance")[/i]
[*]Kingdom of Hungary: Magyar and Avar culture
[*]Kingdom of Lithuania: Baltic culture group and Romuva religion
[*]Kingdoms of Croatia, Serbia and Carinthia: "South Western Slavic" cultures (Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian, Carinthian)
[*]Kingdoms of Bulgaria and Dacia: "South Eastern Slavic" cultures (Bulgarian, Romanian)
[*]Kingdoms of Denmark, Norway and Sweden (and Saxony if it is non-titular): Saxon culture, North Germanic culture group, and Germanic religion
[*]"Finnish group":
[list]
[*]Kingdoms of Estonia, Finland and Sapmi: "Western Finnish" cultures (Finnish, Lappish, Estonian)
[*]Kingdoms of Nenets and Perm: "Northern Finnish" cultures (Komi, Samoyed, Mordvin, Meshchera)
[*]Kingdom of Sibir: "Siberian Finnish" cultures (Khanty)
[*]All "Finnish group" kingdoms: Suomenskuo religion
[/list]
[*]"Nomad group":
[list]
[*]Kingdom of Volga Bulgaria: Bolghar culture
[*]Kingdoms of Khazaria & Crimea: Khazar culture & Jewish religion
[*]Kingdom of Alania: Alan culture
[*]All "Nomad group" kingdoms: Tengri religion
[/list]
[*]After achieving all of the above: All interim bloodlines are deleted and merged into a single "final" bloodline that is slightly-better than the sum of its parts.
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
For almost all of my mods, including this one, my aim is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list]
[*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game:
[list]
[*]If any mod-added custom bloodlines exist: No
[*]If no mod-added custom bloodlines exist: Yes
[/list]
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: None (I've never seen the AI form the Slavic Union)
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor (it's just revolt risk and opinion - no overpowered CBs etc)
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Probably complete (I can't think of any features to add, but I'm open to suggestions)
[/list]
