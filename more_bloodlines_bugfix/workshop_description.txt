[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This micro-mod fixes several bugs in the "More Bloodlines" mod:
[list]
[*]The tyrant bloodline can now be earned.
[*]"Femwar" bloodlines can now be earned.
[*]Magnum Opuses count towards the writer bloodline.
[*]The reformist bloodline is locked to whichever religion you reform, and optionally grants a cool nickname.
[*]The family bloodline only triggers if >=2% of all dynasty members are inbred (more sensible for large dynasties).
[*]Misc localisation fixes (spelling, grammar, etc).
