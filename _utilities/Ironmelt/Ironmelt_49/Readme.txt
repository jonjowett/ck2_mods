IRONMELT
Readme file

===

Ironmelt is a program designed to decode binary savegame files generated by some Clausewitz Engine games (mainly for Ironman games) to save them in human-readable text format.

Currently Ironmelt supports Europa Universalis IV and Crusader Kings II, both compressed and uncompressed files. The program exports decoded files without compression.

To decode a file, choose its path (drag and drop of file on the respective field works and dropping a file on Ironmelt EXE works too) and click 'Decode' button. 

Options:
Save to local savegames folder - The resulting file will get saved in the same directory as the source file unless it is outside of standard savegame folders and this option is checked; in this case, the savegame will be exported to the local savegame folder inside your Documents folder.
Prevent overwrite of the original file - If you choose an option to prevent overwriting of the original file, a suffix will be added to the name of the output file as needed.
Mitigate errors - Unknown tokens are the most common type of possible errors; if error mitigation options is on, the program removes unrecognized binary portions of the file from the output; this means that some data will be lost but it may let you load a file that otherwise makes the game crash when loading (it is highly recommended to turn this option on as you still will be warned about errors and sometimes eliminated snippets may contain no crucial information).
Decode to a compressed savegame - The resulting decoded file will be compressed in the same format as compressed savegames. Note that for Random New World files this setting will be always treated as on.

In case of a problem please let me know through the forum so I can try to fix the issue for the next version of the program.

4.9 (2019-07-07)
- some additions to EU4 tokens

4.8 (2018-04-08)
- some additions and fixes to EU4 tokens

- some changes to how checksums omission is hadled

4.6 (2018-01-14)
- added big number of new CK2, EU4 and a couple of HoI4 tokens
- small fixes to previous tokens (mainly regarding quotes placement)

4.5 (2017-08-24)
- if the program is run with proper file path as a command line argument, it will automatically decode this file and close
- added a lot of new HoI4 tokens
- a few EU4 tokens added

4.4 (2017-07-17)
- fixed startup process for potential crashes
- added a lot of new EU4 tokens

4.3 (2017-06-24)
- update of tokens support for the newest versions of games and several fixes to already supported ones
- if path textbox contains proper location, clicking Browse button will set initial directory of Open file window to this path
- removed dependency on DotNetZip project (archived savegames are now handled natively)
- fixed 'Decode to a compressed savegame' function
- icon change for better visibility
- some changes to parsing methods

4.2 (2017-03-05)
- a few tokens added to maintain the program up-to-date with recent patches of EU4 and CK2

4.1 (2016-10-30)
- complete support for Hearts of Iron IV (as the conversion functionality is available through the game itself, this will serve mainly Chronicle or other projects)
- fixed a lot of unsupported tokens for Europa Universalis IV
- some other tokens added, accouting for the newest patches of EU4 and CK2

4.0 (2016-09-08)
- the program now runs by default as 64-bit process (should help with with very large files)
- some problems with shared access to savegame files fixed
- there is _very_ limited support for Hearts of Iron IV (very partial conversion for now, no realistic chance to run converted file)
- options for folders in menu shown only for existing folders
- a lot of new tokens for CK2, very few new tokens for EU4

3.4 (2016-05-03)
- a lot of new tokens for EU4 supported (for Mare Nostrum patch)
- fixed problems with encoding
- fixed some quirks with compression setting
- fixed Steam paths lookup

3.3 (2016-03-21)
- Random New World in EU4 is now supported
- the program has got an update check feature
- a lot of new tokens for EU4 (mainly RNW-related)
- a few new tokens for CK2

3.2 (2016-02-24)
- new tokens added and some others fixed for CK2

3.1 (2016-02-14)
- a lot of new tokens and fixes for EU4 and CK2
- errors are now sorted, by their appearance count
- "Save to local savegames folder" will retain the file in the original location if it is in a mod subfolder
- "Prevent overwrite of the original file" no longer generates "*_1_1" filenames
- conversion of renamed compressed savegames (where the name of the savegame does not equal name of the archive) now works
- fixed identification of 'date'-type entries in EU4 savegames
- all output files are created now with Unix-type end-of-file characters (\n)

3.0 (2015-10-01)
- complete rework of parsing and decoding mechanism for better flexibility and reliability
- better and more informative error reporting
- some changes to the interface
- progress bar now works
- converted savegames can be saved with appended indices to prevent overwriting of original files
- the program has an icon now too :)
- some additions and removals for EU4 and CK2 tokens

2.5 (2015-09-19)
- fixed errors with reading uncompressed binary files
- clean up option renamed to 'mitigate errors' and made on by default
- a lot of new additions and fixes to CK2 tokens, few additions to EU4 tokens set

2.4 (2015-08-18)
- new tokens and a lot of fixes for EU4
- the program makes better checking whether destination place is in use (should make adding timestamp to filenames much less frequent)
- if destination is set as 'copy to local savegame folder' the program will usually not warn about overwriting

2.3 (2015-08-08):
- if the intended output path is in use and cannot be written to, the program will construct an alternative file name and proceed
- made additional safeguards against malformed definitions of removed content in CK2 savegames so that the savegame writing should succeed
