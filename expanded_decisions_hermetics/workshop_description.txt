[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod aims to make the Hermetic society a bit more enjoyable and worthwhile for players who wish to stay in the society long-term.

[h1]Features:[/h1]

[u]Auto-Stargazing:[/u]
[list]
[*]The vanilla "Invite to Stargazing" decision is annoying to use, because you have to manually locate your guest every time, and you have to manually keep track of the cooldown. Therefore, even though this event chain is fairly detailed and extremely easy to start, it's not often seen by players.
[*]This mod adds an [u]intrigue menu decision[/u] which automatically locates a guest and invites them to stargaze with you. The event chain then proceeds as per vanilla.
[*]Guests with compatible traits (ie. more likely to produce a good outcome) are prioritised.
[list][*]You will still need to choose the correct event options to take advantage of these compatible traits![/list]
[/list]

[u]Call a Gathering of Great Minds:[/u]
[list]
[*]The Gathering of Great Minds event chain is one of the great attractions of the Hermetic Society, since it can produce advanced artifacts. However, it is entirely random, which means that you might just get unlucky.
[*]This mod adds an [u]intrigue menu decision[/u] which allows characters with a LOT of society currency (3000) to manually call a gathering, at most once every 5 years.
[*]After the initial trigger, the vanilla gathering event chain (including selection of participants) is unaltered.
[/list]

[u]Write Another Magnum Opus:[/u]
[list]
[*]In vanilla, you can only ever write one Magnum Opus per lifetime. This seems relatively unrealistic, as it seems to imply that your character can't learn anything new for the rest of their life. (Which is especially egregious for immortal characters and those who write their Magnum Opus in their twenties.)
[*]This mod adds a [u]self-targeted decision[/u] that allows characters to write additional Magnum Opuses, at the cost of an EXTREMELY large amount of society currency.
[*]The cost increases with number of previous Magnum Opuses, and decreases with the amount of time since writing your previous Magnum Opus. For example:
[list]
[*]2nd Magnum Opus, 10 years after the 1st: 10000 currency
[*]2nd Magnum Opus, 50 years after the 1st: 1000 currency
[*]4th Magnum Opus, 10 years after the 3rd: 40000 currency
[*]4th Magnum Opus, 50 years after the 3rd: 5000 currency
[/list]
[*]The new maximum number of Magnum Opuses per lifetime is 4. (This should be enough even for immortals!)
[*]The Magnum Opus event chain is unchanged from vanilla (eg. you still can't write duplicates).
[/list]

[u]Acquire Ingredients (bypassing cooldown):[/u]
[list]
[*]Sometimes, you want to acquire more ingredients, and you don't want to wait for the cooldown for the base game decision to run out.
[*]This decision allows you to spend 100 society currency (or 200, the second time) to gather more ingredients (using the same events as per the base game's decision).
