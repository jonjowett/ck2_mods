# Reward for Christian character who reconquers Iberia after it was previously conquered by non-Christians
# Based on the vanilla reconquista bloodlines
#  --- Christians and Iberians are grateful.
#  --- Arabs and especially Andalusians are annoyed at being pushed out of the peninsula.
#  --- No combat modifier, because it's not in vanilla and because there are too many combat modifiers in general and because the founder didn't necessarily distinguish themselves in personal combat.
