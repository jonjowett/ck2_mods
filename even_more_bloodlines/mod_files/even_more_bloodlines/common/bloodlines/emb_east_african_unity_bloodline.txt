# Grants East African opinion (which includes Daju, because I'm lazy and it already exists in vanilla),
#    and characters with the bloodline can build all relevant retinues and all relevant cultural buildings (in non-Daju East-African-culture provinces).
# Does NOT apply to vassals, unless they also have the culture.
