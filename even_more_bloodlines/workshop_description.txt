[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This mod (inspired by and compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994155763]More Bloodlines[/url]) adds several new earnable bloodlines, most of which will require concerted effort over several characters' lifetimes:
[list]
[*] For carrying out extremely large numbers of raids
[*] For conquering a truly massive amount of land in a single war
[*] For creating a dynasty of famous women (ie. having several female bloodline founders as ancestors)
[*] For creating a dynasty of erudite Hermetics
[*] For reconquering Iberia as a Christian, after it was fully conquered by a Muslim
[*] For unifying all Celtic cultures
[*] For unifying all East African cultures
[/list]



[h1]Specifics:[/h1]

[h3]Raider Bloodline:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Perform 200 raids in one lifetime.
[*] Awarded by event immediately after sacking the 200th holding.
[list][*] [i](This replaces the base game bloodline which is awarded to Germanic characters on their 200th raid.)[/i][/list]
[*] If you have no other raider bloodline: gain Sea King/Queen trait & a copy of the Ragnarr bloodline (descendants can earn Pirate/Ravager/Sea King/Queen).
[*] If you already have a raider bloodline: Gain one of several other raider-themed bloodlines.
[list][*] [i](It is possible to gain multiple Raider bloodlines, over several lifetimes.)[/i][/list]
[/list]

[h3]Ultimate Raider bloodline:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Perform 400 raids in one lifetime.
[list][*] [i](This is challenging - it usually requires a dedicated focus on raiding for several decades.)[/i][/list]
[*] Awarded by event immediately after sacking the 400th holding.
[*] Non-Germanic Sea Kings/Queens with this bloodline can use the coastal county conquest CB.
[/list]

[h3]Massive Conquest:[/h3]
[list]
[*] [u]Personally[/u] gain 50 counties as the result of a single war.
[list][*] [i](You must literally gain 50 county titles, which probably requires some kind of invasion CB. Pressing a kingdom/empire claim will not suffice.)[/i][/list]
[*] Awarded by event a few days after the end of the war.
[list][*] [i](Recommendation: Take a backup save before making peace, eg. if you're uncertain about the number of provinces transferred.)[/i][/list]
[*] Gain the ability to use the Tribal Invasion CB once per lifetime.
[list][*] [i](This is the same as for the base game's Alexander/Ashoka bloodlines. However, it does not stack - you still only get one per lifetime!)[/i][/list]
[/list]

[h3]Feminine Power:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Be female, found a bloodline, and be an active member of two other bloodlines founded by two different women.
[*] Awarded by intrigue menu decision.
[*] Gives access to Enatic-Cognatic succession.
[*] Gain additional features if any of you or your two ancestors are: Shieldmaiden, Homosexual, and/or Seductress.
[/list]

[h3]Hermetic:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Be a Magus in the Hermetics, with very high learning, with an Emerald Tablet, and with a large number of quality 3 or 4 Magnum Opuses.
[*] Awarded by intrigue menu decision.
[*] Children with this bloodline have their learning education upgraded on adulthood.
[list][*] [i](This can stack with the upgrade granted by a learning-focused horoscope!)[/i][/list]
[*] Additional features if you also have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2852676163]ED: Society Joining[/url]:
[list]
[*] Increased society currency gain in the Hermetics
[*] Increased member score in the Hermetics (ie. more likely to be made Grandmaster)
[*] AI characters with this bloodline are more likely to join the Hermetics
[/list]
[/list]

[h3]Full Reconquista:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Requirements:
[list]
[*] First trigger: At most 3 provinces in mainland Iberia are owned by Christians. (Checked once per year.)
[*] Second trigger: All provinces in mainland Iberia are in your realm.
[*] [i]("Mainland Iberia" means the entire region of Iberia, except the duchy of Mallorca.)[/i]
[/list]
[*] Awarded by intrigue menu decision.
[*] Christians and Iberians like you; Arabs and especially Andalusians hate you.
[list][*] [i](Unlike other bloodlines in this mod, this one doesn't grant any interesting new mechanics. This is mainly because I can't think of any that are both thematic and can easily be implemented. Suggestions welcome!)[/i][/list]
[/list]

[h3]Celtic Unity:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Be of Celtic culture; own 1 province of your culture; own 1 province of a different Celtic culture; own 20 provinces of Celtic culture in Western Europe; own [u]all[/u] Celtic culture provinces in Western Europe.
[*] Awarded by intrigue menu decision.
[*] For whichever Celtic cultures exist in Western Europe on bloodline formation:
[list]
[*] Celtic independent rulers and their Celtic vassals gain access to all Celtic military buildings and retinues.
[*] Celtic independent rulers and their Celtic vassals have a greatly increased chance to convert non-Celtic provinces to their culture.
[/list]
[/list]

[h3]East African Unity:[/h3]
[list]
[*] Be of East African culture; own at least 1 province of Ethiopian, Somali and Nubian culture; own 20 provinces of East African culture in East Africa; own [u]all[/u] East African culture provinces in East Africa.
[*] Awarded by intrigue menu decision.
[*] East African independent rulers and their East African vassals gain access to all East African military buildings and retinues.
[*] East African independent rulers and their East African vassals have a greatly increased chance to convert non-East African provinces to their culture.
[*] [i](NB: The East African culture group also includes Daju, but this culture does [u]not[/u] count for any of the above. (Because it's not in East Africa, it has no special features, and it frequently disappears.))[/i]
[/list]

[*]If any mod-added custom bloodlines exist: No
[*]If no mod-added custom bloodlines exist: Yes
[/list]
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: None (these bloodlines are probably too difficult for the AI to earn)
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Part-complete (more bloodline types will be added, a few features are not yet implemented)
[/list]
