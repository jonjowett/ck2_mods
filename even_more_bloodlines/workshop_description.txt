[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This mod (inspired by and compatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1994155763]More Bloodlines[/url]) adds a few new earnable bloodlines:
[list][*][u]Raider bloodlines[/u]
[list][*]200 raids & no other raider bloodline: Sea King/Queen trait & copy of Ragnarr bloodline (descendants can earn Pirate/Ravager/Sea King/Queen)
[*]200 raids & already a member of previous raider bloodline: One of several random additional raider-themed bloodlines
[*]400 raids: "Ultimate" bloodline, allowing non-Germanic Sea Kings/Queens to use the coastal county conquest CB
[/list]
[*](Other bloodline types are in development)
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
For almost all of my mods, including this one, my aim is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.

[*]If no mod-added custom bloodlines exist: Yes
