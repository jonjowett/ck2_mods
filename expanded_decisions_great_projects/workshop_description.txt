[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This micro-mod allows players to add extra improvement slots to great projects, at exponentially-increasing cost. (Via targeted decision on the county coat of arms.)

This allows a lot more flexibility in choice of improvements compared with the base game, where the maximum number of improvements per great work is 8. (Or perhaps 9, if you manage to complete the "Build a Great Work" ambition.) Realistically, adding more than 2-3 extra slots is usually far too expensive to be worthwhile, but even that small amount of extra capacity usually makes your choices a lot easier and this aspect of the game a lot more enjoyable.

Secondarily, the debugging features of this mod allow players to: destroy great projects, add/remove improvement slots, and destroy improvements. (These debugging features are best used in conjunction with the "quickbuild" console command, so that you can near-instantly rebuild great works to your liking.)
