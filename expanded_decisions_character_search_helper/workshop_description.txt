[h1]Summary:[/h1]

This mod adds dynamic traits to characters, making it easier to search for them using the in-game "character finder".

The specific trait names allow you to perform wide searches with simple queries. [i](Eg: "CSH-V" for everyone with >=300 gold.)[/i]

You can turn off these traits temporarily via an intrigue menu decision. [i](Eg: if you want to avoid clutter or increase performance.)[/i] [i](NB: In multiplayer games, only the host can do this.)[/i]

For performance reasons, these traits are gradually updated once per year per character. If necessary, you can [u]force[/u] a global update via an intrigue menu decision. [i](NB: In multiplayer games, only the host can do this.)[/i]




[h1]Searchable Traits:[/h1]

[i]NB: To avoid cluttering your own character's profile, these custom traits will [u]not[/u] be added to any human players.[/i]

[h3]Foes[/h3]
[list]
[*] The "CSH-Foe" trait is added to all characters who are "foes" (ie. valid duelling targets) of a human player.
[list][*] [i](Because sometimes you want a duel opponent, so you can increase your skill, but you can't locate any valid targets. Eg: If you have few/no rivals.)[/i][/list]
[*] Multiplayer support: The trait is only visible if the character is [u]your[/u] foe. (Your fellow players' foes will not show up in search results.)
[/list]

[h3]Wealth[/h3]
[list]
[*] Added to all characters who have more than a trivial amount of cash.
[*] Specific thresholds:
[list]
[*] "CSH-Rich" : 100-300 gold
[*] "CSH-VRich" : 300-1k gold
[*] "CSH-VVRich" : 1k-3k gold
[*] "CSH-VVVRich" : 3k-10k gold
[*] "CSH-VVVVRich" : >10k gold
[/list][/list]

[h3]Artifacts[/h3]
[list]
[*] "CSH-Q..." traits are added to all characters who have an artifact of the specified quality.
[list][*] [i](Eg: A character with an artifact of quality 3 will have the "CSH-Q3" trait.)[/i][/list]
[*] Intrigue menu decisions allow you to hide these traits if you already own the artifact in question.
[list][*] [i](IE: Since it's often pointless to own more than one of any artifact, you can use the intrigue menu filters in conjunction with the "CSH-Q..." traits to locate artifacts which you do not already own.)[/i][/list]
[*] Supports artifacts up to [u]quality 9[/u] (ie. granular support for most modded artifacts)
[list][*] [i](Owners of artifacts with quality >= 9 receive the "CSH-Q9" trait - ie. extremely high-quality modded artifacts are supported, but they cannot be differentiated.)[/i][/list]
[/list]
