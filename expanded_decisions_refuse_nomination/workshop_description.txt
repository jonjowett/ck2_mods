[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod allows players to refuse nominations for all elective-type titles.

This can be useful in several fairly-niche situations. For example:
[list][*]If you have relocated to a different part of the world, and don't want to inherit elective titles from your origin.
[*]If you are a vassal of an elective empire (eg. HRE, Byz) and you don't want to become emperor.
[*]If your vassals are elective, and you don't want to inherit their titles.
[/list]
