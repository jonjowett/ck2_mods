[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod adds targeted decisions which allow the player to encourage other female characters to become pregnant.

This "Encourage Pregnancy" decision is made less "cheaty" and more immersive by the specific way it works:
[list]
[*]The pregnancy is not forced immediately, instead it is forced at a random future time depending on the couple's joint fertility. (If they are relatively infertile, the pregnancy will occur further in the future.)
[*]If a normal pregnancy occurs before the random future date then the mod-added "encouraged pregnancy" will not occur.
[*]If the mod-added "encouraged pregnancy" is not valid at the selected future date (eg. death/divorce/infertility) then it will not occur.
[/list]

This mod is intended primarily as a workaround for certain engine limitations - eg. to help with bloodline breeding programs, where unlanded nondynastic courtiers are limited to very few children even if they have high fertility.

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
