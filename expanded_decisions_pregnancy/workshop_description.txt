[b][u]I am temporarily unable to update this mod due to a bug in Steam Workshop. In the meantime, if you want the latest version, you can download it in [url=https://github.com/jonjowett/ck2_mods/blob/master/expanded_decisions_pregnancy/packaged_mod/expanded_decisions_pregnancy.zip]zip format[/url].[/u][/b]

[h1]Summary:[/h1]
This mod adds targeted decisions which allow the player to encourage other female characters to become pregnant.

This "Encourage Pregnancy" decision is made less "cheaty" and more immersive by the specific way it works:
[list]
[*]The pregnancy is not forced immediately, instead it is forced at a random future time depending on the couple's joint fertility. (If they are relatively infertile, the pregnancy will occur further in the future.)
[*]If a normal pregnancy occurs before the random future date then the mod-added "encouraged pregnancy" will not occur.
[*]If the mod-added "encouraged pregnancy" is not valid at the selected future date (eg. death/divorce/infertility) then it will not occur.
[/list]

This mod is intended primarily as a workaround for certain engine limitations - eg. to help with bloodline breeding programs, where unlanded nondynastic courtiers are limited to very few children even if they have high fertility.

[h1]Compatibility/Impact:[/h1]
The aim of the "Expanded Decisions" mod family is to be as compatible as possible with vanilla CK2 (and other mods), and to avoid making the game easier.
[list][*]Required CK2 version: 3.3.5.1
[*]Achievement compatible: No
[*]Safe to add to existing game: Yes
[*]Safe to remove from existing game:
[list][*]If any "encouraged pregnancy" is scheduled for a future date: [b][u]At your own risk[/u][/b] [i](I [u]think[/u] there will be an error in the CK2 error log and no other problems, but I'm not sure.)[/i]
[*]Otherwise: Yes [i](Eg. If you've waited >20 years since the last time anyone used the "encourage pregnancy" decision)[/i][/list]
[*]Changes to vanilla files: None
[*]Mod compatibility: Should be compatible with all other mods
[*]Changes to AI behaviour: None
[*]Decrease in game difficulty: Minor
[*]Localisation: English only
[*]Mod development status: Mostly complete
[list][*]Some of the debugging events have incorrect text[/list][/list]
